Here’s a detailed and specific breakdown of the differences among the four files, which can be used to cluster them into four categories:

Clustering

Based on these differences, the files can be categorized into four clusters:
	1.	Cluster 1: Historical and Biographical Narratives
	•	Includes File 1.
	•	Focuses on labor activism, biographies, and political movements.
	2.	Cluster 2: Cultural and Artifacts-Oriented Content
	•	Includes File 2.
	•	Focuses on artifacts, exhibitions, and their historical significance.
	3.	Cluster 3: Fictional and Game Lore
	•	Includes File 3.
	•	Dedicated to video game characters, storylines, and mechanics.
	4.	Cluster 4: Mixed Media (Wrestling and Opera)
	•	Includes File 4.
	•	Covers professional wrestling narratives and opera company histories.

This mapping clearly highlights the unique features and focus areas of each file, making clustering straightforward and defensible. Let me know if further analysis is needed!
