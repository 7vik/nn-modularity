<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> A study in 2011 by Douglas Miller shows that in English county cricket, the proportion of wickets to fall lbw has increased steadily since the First World War. In the 1920s, around 11 % of wickets were lbw but this rose to 14 % in the 1930s. Between 1946 and 1970, the proportion was approximately 11 % but subsequently increased until reaching almost 19 % in the decade before 2010. Miller also states that captains of county teams were statistically more likely to receive the benefit of lbw decisions — less likely to be out lbw when batting and more likely to dismiss batsmen lbw when bowling. For many years, county captains submitted end @-@ of @-@ match reports on the umpires ; as umpires were professionals whose careers could be affected, captains consequently received <unk> whether batting or bowling. Before 1963, when the status was abolished in county cricket, umpires were also more lenient towards amateur cricketers. <unk> administered English cricket, and offending one could end an umpire's career. Elsewhere in the world, lbws are more statistically likely in matches taking place on the Indian subcontinent. However, batsmen from the subcontinent were less likely to be lbw wherever they played in the world. 
<|endoftext|> Teams that toured other countries often became frustrated by lbws given against them ; there was often an assumption of national bias by home umpires against visiting teams. Several studies investigating this perception have suggested that home batsmen are sometimes less likely than visiting batsmen to be lbw. However, the data is based on lbw decisions awarded, not on the success @-@ rate of appeals to the umpire. Fraser points out that it is impossible to determine from these studies if any of the decisions were wrong, particularly as the lbw law can have different interpretations, or if other factors such as pitch conditions and technique were involved. A 2006 study examined the effect that neutral umpires had on the rate of lbws. Although the reasons were again ambiguous, it found that lbws increased slightly under neutral umpires regardless of team or location. 
<|endoftext|> In his survey of cricket laws, Gerald Brodribb suggests that " no dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw ; it has caused trouble from its earliest days ". Among those who do not follow cricket, the law has the reputation of being extremely difficult to understand, of equivalent complexity to association football's offside rule. Owing to the difficulty of its interpretation, lbw is regarded by critics as the most controversial of the laws but also a <unk> by which an umpire's abilities are judged. In his book Cricket and the Law : The Man in White Is Always Right, David Fraser writes that umpires'lbw decisions are frequently criticised and " arguments about bias and incompetence in <unk> inform almost every discussion about lbw decisions. " Problems arise because the umpire has not only to establish what has happened but also to speculate over what might have occurred. <unk> aspects of lbw decisions include the umpire having to determine whether the ball pitched outside leg stump, and in certain circumstances whether the batsman intended to hit the ball or leave it alone. <unk> are frequently criticised for their lbw decisions by players, commentators and spectators. Historically, trouble ranging from protests and arguments to crowd demonstrations occasionally arose from disputed decisions. For example, a prolonged crowd disturbance, in which items were thrown onto the playing field and the match was delayed, took place when <unk> <unk> was <unk> lbw during a 1996 One Day International in India.

Applewhite also sought to prevent close friendships among his followers, fearing that this could lead to insubordination. Applewhite and Nettles insisted that their followers practice what they referred to as " flexibility " : strict obedience to their often shifting requests. The two leaders limited the group's contacts with those outside the movement, even some who may have been interested in joining, ostensibly to prevent infiltration from hostile parties. In practice, this made their followers completely dependent upon them. Applewhite instructed his disciples to be like children or pets in their submission — their sole responsibility was to obey their leaders. Members were encouraged to constantly seek Applewhite's advice and often ask themselves what their leaders would do when making a decision. To his followers, he did not seem dictatorial : many of them found him laid back and <unk>. In his 2000 study of the group, Winston Davis states that Applewhite mastered the " fine art of religious entertainment ", noting that many of his disciples seemed to enjoy their service. Applewhite organized seemingly arbitrary rituals that were intended to <unk> a sense of discipline in his followers ; he referred to these tasks as " games ".

Applewhite and Nettles had about 40 followers then and lived in two or three houses : the leaders usually had their own house. The group was secretive about their lifestyle, covering their windows. Applewhite and Nettles arranged their followers'lifestyles as a boot camp that would prepare them for the Next Level. Referring to their house as a " craft ", they <unk> the lives of their disciples to the minute. Students who were not committed to this lifestyle were encouraged to leave ; departing members were given financial assistance. Lifton states that Applewhite wanted " quality over quantity " in his followers, although he occasionally spoke about gaining many converts. 
<|endoftext|> Applewhite and Nettles sometimes made sudden, drastic changes to the group. On one occasion in Texas, they told their followers of a forthcoming visitation from extraterrestrials and instructed them to wait outside all night, at which point they informed them that this had been merely a test.

His attempt to explain her death in the terms of the group's doctrine was successful, preventing the departure of all but one member. Applewhite became very depressed.

This was due to the fact that standard condoms were too wide and consequently failed to afford protection to adolescent boys during vaginal and anal intercourse. Family planning groups and the Swiss AIDS Federation had campaigned to have a narrower condom produced for youths after a number of studies, including a government study researched at the Centre for Development and Personality Psychology at Basel University, found that standard condoms were unsuitable for boys in this age range, and that the condoms either failed during use or that the boys rejected them altogether because they were too wide, and consequently they used no protection at all.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The Cambodian Campaign ( also known as the Cambodian <unk> and the Cambodian Invasion ) was a series of military operations conducted in eastern Cambodia during 1970 by the United States and the Republic of Vietnam ( South Vietnam ) ( <unk> ) during the Vietnam War. These invasions were a result of the policy of President Richard Nixon. A total of 13 major operations were conducted by the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) between 29 April and 22 July and by US forces between 1 May and 30 June. 
<|endoftext|> The objective of the campaign was the defeat of the approximately 40 @,@ 000 troops of the People's Army of Vietnam ( PAVN ) and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam ( NLF, also known as Viet Cong ) who were <unk> in the eastern border regions of Cambodia. Cambodia's official neutrality and military weakness made its territory effectively a safe zone where Vietnamese communist forces could establish bases for operations over the border. With the US shifting toward a policy of Vietnamization and withdrawal, the US sought to shore up the South Vietnamese government's security by eliminating the cross @-@ border threat. 
<|endoftext|> A change in the Cambodian government allowed a window of opportunity for the destruction of the base areas in 1970 when Prince <unk> Sihanouk was deposed and replaced by pro @-@ US General Lon Nol. Allied military operations failed to eliminate many communist troops or to capture their elusive headquarters, known as the Central Office for South Vietnam ( COSVN ), but the haul of captured material in Cambodia prompted claims of success.

Thus a move for White and then one for Black gives about 103 possibilities. A typical game lasts about 40 moves to resignation of one party. This is conservative for our calculation since the machine would calculate out to <unk>, not resignation. However, even at this figure there will be <unk> variations to be calculated from the initial position. A machine operating at the rate of one variation per <unk> would require over <unk> years to calculate the first move! 
<|endoftext|> It is thus theoretically possible to " solve " chess, determining with certainty whether a perfectly played game should end in a win for White, a draw, or even a win for Black. However, according to Shannon the time frame required puts this possibility beyond the limits of any feasible technology. 
<|endoftext|> Hans @-@ Joachim <unk>, a professor of mathematics and <unk> at the University of California at Berkeley, further argued in a 1965 paper that the " speed, memory, and processing capacity of any possible future computer equipment are limited by certain physical barriers : the light barrier, the quantum barrier, and the <unk> barrier. These limitations imply, for example, that no computer, however constructed, will ever be able to examine the entire tree of possible move sequences of the game of chess. " Nonetheless, <unk> did not <unk> the possibility that a computer would someday be able to solve chess. He wrote, " In order to have a computer play a perfect or nearly perfect game [ of chess ] it will be necessary either to analyze the game completely... or to analyze the game in an approximate way and combine this with a limited amount of tree searching.... A theoretical understanding of such <unk> programming, however, is still very much wanting. " 
<|endoftext|> Recent scientific advances have not significantly changed that assessment. The game of checkers was solved in 2007, but it has roughly the square root of the number of positions in chess. Jonathan <unk>, the scientist who led the effort, said a breakthrough such as quantum computing would be needed before solving chess could even be attempted, but he does not rule out the possibility, saying that the one thing he learned from his 16 @-@ year effort of solving checkers " is to never <unk> the advances in technology ".

Madero responded positively although he also stated that any kind of peace deal had to include an immediate resignation by Díaz. 
<|endoftext|> Faced with the siege of Ciudad Juárez and the outbreak of rebellion in Morelos, Díaz and members of his cabinet became more willing to negotiate and launched a " <unk> peace offensive " aimed at Madero. This was largely a result of panic among the large landowners associated with the Díaz regime ( the <unk> ) and the financial elite, which represented a " moderate " wing within the government. Some among the <unk> in fact, expected that Zapata would soon march on Mexico City itself, unless peace was concluded with Madero. 
<|endoftext|> The moderate view within the Díaz government was represented by Jorge <unk> Estañol who in a <unk> to the minister of foreign affairs wrote that there were two <unk> taking place in Mexico : a political revolution, based mostly in the north, whose aim was mostly to establish free elections and remove Díaz himself from power, and a social revolution whose aim was " anarchy " which was spreading throughout the Mexican countryside. Estañol recommended coming to terms with the first group of revolutionaries, by agreeing to the principle of no re @-@ election and a general amnesty, in order to prevent the second group from succeeding. In addition to his fear of " anarchy ", Estañol was also worried that the social revolution would lead to a military intervention by the United States.

<|endoftext|> These social group were in turn opposed by the more reactionary elements within Díaz's government, mostly concentrated in the federal army, who though that the rebels should be dealt with through brute force. This faction was represented by General <unk> Huerta, who would later carry out an attempted coup d 'état against Madero. Likewise, the general, and potential successor to Díaz, Bernardo Reyes stated in a letter to Limantour that " the repression ( against the insurrectionists ) should be carried out with the <unk> energy, punishing without any pity anyone participating in the armed struggle ". In the end however, Díaz dismissed the advice from his generals as " <unk> @-@ like <unk> " and chose to seek peace with the moderate wing of the revolution. Limantour had finally managed to persuade him to resign. 
<|endoftext|> At the same time there was also disagreement among the rebels. The " left wing " of the revolutionary movement, represented by Zapata and Orozco ( Villa for the time being tended to support Madero ), warned against any possible compromises with Díaz.

These incidents included the 1956 <unk> kidnapping and murder, the 1960 murder of the Mirabal sisters, and the 1961 split with the Catholic Church.

The government's actions in The Feast of the Goat demonstrate the discourse of prohibition : foreign newspapers and magazines were prohibited from entering Trujillo's country as they were seen as a threat to the government's ideas. Mario Vargas Llosa takes part in this discourse by recounting what was prohibited. 
<|endoftext|> Ruiz notes that writing also has the power to transform reality. It brings the reader back to the past, allowing the reader to comprehend myths or distorted stories told by historians.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Gameplay = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena ( MOBA ) video game set in a three @-@ dimensional ( 3D ) graphical environment, presented from a high @-@ angle perspective. Two five @-@ player teams, referred to as the Radiant and Dire, compete in matches on a single asymmetrical playing field. Each player commands one of the 111 characters, called " heroes ", which each feature unique abilities, design, and styles of play. At the start of a match, each hero has an experience level of one. During the game, they level up and become more powerful by accumulating experience points through combat. Whenever a hero gains a level, the player is able to unlock a new ability for them, improve one already learned, or increase their base attributes. Each hero's method of combat is influenced by its primary attribute : strength, intelligence, agility, which also affects the hero's health points ( HP ), <unk> points ( MP ), and attack speed, respectively. If a hero runs out of health points and dies, a <unk> begins to count down until they are able to respawn and get back into the game. A hero also loses a portion of their <unk> gold each time they die. 
<|endoftext|> The Radiant and Dire occupy bases in opposite corners of the playing field, divided by a <unk> river. Within each base is a critical building called the " Ancient ", along with a fountain that <unk> and <unk> that side's heroes. A match ends when one side breaches the enemy team's base and destroys the Ancient within. The two bases are connected by three paths, referred to as " lanes ", which are guarded by defensive towers and computer @-@ controlled creatures called " creeps ". These creatures periodically spawn in groups and travel along the lanes to attack any enemy heroes, creeps, and buildings in sight. <unk> spawn from two buildings, called the " barracks ", that exist in each lane and are located in the base. Destroying all six of the enemy team's barracks allows for stronger creeps for the attacking side to spawn with significantly enhanced health and damage, known as " mega creeps ". Also present are " neutral creeps " that are hostile to both Radiant and Dire side, and reside in marked locations on the map known as " camps ". Camps are located in the area between the lanes known as the " jungle ", which both sides of the map have. <unk> creeps do not attack unless provoked, and will respawn if killed. The most powerful neutral <unk> is named " <unk> ", who is a unique boss that may be killed by either side to obtain an item that allows a one @-@ time resurrection by the hero that holds it. <unk> will respawn between 8 – 11 minutes after being killed, and becomes progressively harder to kill as the match continues over time. 
<|endoftext|> Gold is primarily obtained by killing enemy heroes, destroying enemy structures, and killing creeps, the latter act being called " farming ". Only the hero that lands the killing blow on a <unk> obtains gold from it, an act called " last hitting ", but all nearby allies receive gold when an enemy hero dies. Players are also able to " deny " allied units and structures by destroying them, which then prevents their opponents from getting full experience. Gold is then spent on items that provide unique active and passive abilities, in addition to attribute <unk> to their wearer, depending on the item. The player also receives a small, continuous stream of gold over the course of a match.

It is believed that Old Pine Church was also used by German <unk>. The Brethren was a Christian denomination of Anabaptist origin that practiced baptism by <unk> immersion and exercised <unk>. <unk> immersion consists of dipping a new believer into water three times, once for each of the entities of the Holy Trinity. Brethren adherents believed only in the New Testament, and professed no other creeds. The interior of Old Pine Church, which consists of a single common space for all worshippers, also illustrates the building's connection with the Brethren and the denomination's beliefs regarding slavery. According to the minutes from the 1782 meeting of the Brethren in Franklin County, Virginia, " It has been unanimously considered that it cannot be permitted in any way by the church that a member should purchase <unk> or keep them as <unk>. " While many residents in Hampshire County prior to the American Civil War were <unk>, it is thought that Brethren adherents in the county did not own slaves or depend upon slave labor. 
<|endoftext|> The Brethren denomination had been present in the South Branch Potomac River valley from as early as the <unk> although records of early Brethren congregations are not extant, possibly because they were served by itinerant ministers. As early as 1785, two brothers with the surname of Powers led a Brethren congregation in the area. In Dr. <unk> F. <unk>'s historical research on the Brethren Church in Hampshire County in his Allegheny Passage ( 1990 ), it is noted that the Church of the Brethren denomination recognized Old Pine Church as belonging to the larger Beaver Run congregation, which was centered approximately 10 miles ( 16 km )

While Frank is Machiavellian, Claire presents a woman urging on her husband's assertion of power in the image of Lady Macbeth.

She encourages his vices while noting her disapproval of his weakness saying " My husband doesn ’ t apologize... even to me. " Nancy <unk> Smith of The Wall Street Journal describes what she sees of their relationship in the first two episodes as pivotal to the show's success : " <unk> though they may seem — and their harmless air is what makes the <unk> so effective as political <unk> — this is a power couple with the same malignant chemistry as pairs of serial <unk>, where each needs the other in order to become lethal ". 
<|endoftext|> Gilbert also notes that Mara's surprising <unk> is a welcome respite against a backdrop of a " terminally <unk> " cast.

In flight, its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive, while on the ground its strange, somewhat <unk> gait is also characteristic. The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings, although the closely related spotless starling may be physically distinguished by the lack of <unk> spots in adult breeding plumage. 
<|endoftext|> Like most terrestrial starlings the common starling moves by walking or running, rather than hopping. Their flight is quite strong and direct ; their triangular @-@ shaped wings beat very rapidly, and periodically the birds <unk> for a short way without losing much height before resuming powered flight. When in a flock, the birds take off almost simultaneously, wheel and turn in <unk>, form a compact mass or trail off into a <unk> stream, bunch up again and land in a coordinated fashion. Common starling on migration can fly at 60 – 80 km / h ( 37 – 50 mph ) and cover up to 1 @,@ 000 – 1 @,@ 500 km ( 620 – 930 mi ). 
<|endoftext|> Several terrestrial starlings, including those in the genus Sturnus, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling ( along with the spotless and white @-@ <unk> starlings ), where the <unk> muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer down the length of the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide. 
<|endoftext|> In Iberia, the western Mediterranean and northwest Africa, the common starling may be confused with the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour.

<|endoftext|> Iguanodon teeth are, as the name suggests, like those of an iguana, but larger. Unlike hadrosaurids, which had columns of replacement teeth, Iguanodon only had one replacement tooth at a time for each position. The upper jaw held up to 29 teeth per side, with none at the front of the jaw, and the lower jaw 25 ; the numbers differ because teeth in the lower jaw are broader than those in the upper. Because the tooth rows are deeply <unk> from the outside of the jaws, and because of other anatomical details, it is believed that, as with most other ornithischians, Iguanodon had some sort of cheek @-@ like structure, muscular or non @-@ muscular, to retain food in the mouth. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Classification and origins = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Iguanodon gives its name to the unranked clade Iguanodontia, a very populous group of ornithopods with many species known from the Middle Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous. Aside from Iguanodon, the best @-@ known members of the clade include <unk>, Camptosaurus, Ouranosaurus, and the duck @-@ bills, or hadrosaurs. In older sources, Iguanodontidae was shown as a distinct family. This family traditionally has been something of a <unk> taxon, including ornithopods that were neither <unk> or hadrosaurids. In practice, animals like <unk>, Camptosaurus, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, <unk>, Ouranosaurus, and <unk> were usually assigned to this family. 
<|endoftext|> With the advent of cladistic analyses, Iguanodontidae as traditionally construed was shown to be <unk>, and these animals are recognised to fall at different points in relation to hadrosaurs on a cladogram, instead of in a single distinct clade. Essentially, the modern concept of Iguanodontidae currently includes only Iguanodon. Groups like <unk> are still used as unranked clades in the scientific literature, though many traditional <unk> are now included in the superfamily <unk>. Iguanodon lies between Camptosaurus and Ouranosaurus in cladograms, and is probably descended from a <unk> @-@ like animal. At one point, Jack Horner suggested, based mostly on skull features, that hadrosaurids actually formed two more distantly related groups, with Iguanodon on the line to the flat @-@ headed <unk>, and Ouranosaurus on the line to the crested lambeosaurines, but his proposal has been rejected.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> One of the first details noted about Iguanodon was that it had the teeth of a herbivorous reptile, although there has not always been consensus on how it ate. As Mantell noted, the remains he was working with were unlike any modern reptile, especially in the toothless, <unk> @-@ shaped form of the lower jaw <unk>, which he found best compared to that of the two @-@ toed <unk> and the extinct ground <unk> <unk>. He also suggested that Iguanodon had a prehensile tongue which could be used to gather food, like a <unk>. More complete remains have shown this to be an error ; for example, the <unk> bones that supported the tongue are heavily built, implying a muscular, non @-@ prehensile tongue used for moving food around in the mouth. The <unk> @-@ tongue idea has also been incorrectly attributed to Dollo via a broken lower jaw. 
<|endoftext|> The skull was structured in such a way that as it closed, the bones holding the teeth in the upper jaw would bow out. This would cause the lower surfaces of the upper jaw teeth to rub against the upper surface of the lower jaw's teeth, grinding anything caught in between and providing an action that is the rough equivalent of mammalian chewing. Because the teeth were always replaced, the animal could have used this mechanism throughout its life, and could eat tough plant material. Additionally, the front ends of the animal's jaws were toothless and tipped with bony nodes, both upper and lower, providing a rough margin that was likely covered and lengthened by a <unk>
<|endoftext|> For much of this poem's history, readers viewed Ulysses as resolute and heroic, <unk> him for his determination " To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield ". The view that Tennyson intended a heroic character is supported by his statements about the poem, and by the events in his life — the death of his closest friend — that prompted him to write it. In the twentieth century, some new interpretations of " Ulysses " highlighted potential <unk> in the poem. They argued, for example, that Ulysses wishes to <unk> abandon his kingdom and family, and they questioned more positive assessments of Ulysses'character by demonstrating how he resembles flawed protagonists in earlier literature.

Ulysses contrasts his present restlessness with his heroic past, and contemplates his old age and eventual death — " Life <unk> on life / Were all too little, and of one to me / Little remains " ( 24 – 26 ) — and longs for further experience and knowledge. His son Telemachus will inherit the throne that Ulysses finds burdensome. While Ulysses thinks that Telemachus will be a good king — " Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere / Of common duties " ( 39 ) — he seems to have lost any connection to his son — " He works his work, I mine " ( 43 ) — and the conventional methods of governing — " by slow prudence " and " through soft degrees " ( 36, 37 ).

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The speaker's language is unadorned but forceful, and it expresses Ulysses'conflicting moods as he searches for continuity between his past and future. There is often a marked contrast between the sentiment of Ulysses'words and the sounds that express them. For example, the poem's <unk> iambic <unk> is often interrupted by spondees ( <unk> feet that consist of two long syllables ) ; such <unk> language slows the poem ( and in other places may cast doubt upon the reliability of Ulysses'utterances ) : 
<|endoftext|> Observing their burdensome <unk> effect, the poet Matthew Arnold remarked, " these three lines by themselves take up nearly as much time as a whole book of the <unk>.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The poem's seventy lines of blank verse are presented as a dramatic monologue. Scholars disagree on how Ulysses'speech functions in this format ; it is not necessarily clear to whom Ulysses is speaking, if anyone, and from what location. Some see the verse turning from a <unk> to a public address, as Ulysses seems to speak to himself in the first movement, then to turn to an audience as he introduces his son, and then to relocate to the <unk> where he addresses his mariners. In this interpretation, the comparatively direct and honest language of the first movement is set against the more politically minded tone of the last two movements. For example, the second paragraph ( 33 – 43 ) about Telemachus, in which Ulysses muses again about domestic life, is a " revised version [ of lines 1 – 5 ] for public consumption " : a " savage race " is revised to a " rugged people ". 
<|endoftext|> The ironic interpretations of " Ulysses " may be the result of the modern tendency to consider the narrator of a dramatic monologue as necessarily " unreliable ".

<|endoftext|> migrations of the Celts being one of the more enduring themes of archaeological and linguistic studies. Today, there is more than one school of thought on how this occurred in Ireland. 
<|endoftext|> The long @-@ standing traditional view, once widely accepted, is that Celtic language, <unk> script and culture were brought to Ireland by waves of invading or migrating Celts from mainland Europe. This theory draws on the <unk> <unk> <unk>, a medieval Christian pseudo @-@ history of Ireland along with the presence of Celtic culture, language and artefacts found in Ireland such as Celtic bronze <unk>, shields, <unk> and other finely crafted Celtic associated possessions. The theory holds that there were four separate Celtic invasions of Ireland. The <unk> were said to be the first, followed by the <unk> from northern Gaul and Britain. Later, <unk> tribes from <unk> ( present @-@ day Brittany ) were said to have invaded Ireland and Britain more or less simultaneously. Lastly, the <unk> ( <unk> ) were said to have reached Ireland from either northern Iberia or southern Gaul. It was claimed that a second wave named the <unk>, belonging to the <unk> people of northern Gaul, began arriving about the sixth century BC. They were said to have given their name to the island. 
<|endoftext|> A more recent theory, with broad support among archaeologists, is that Celtic culture and language arrived in Ireland as a result of cultural <unk>. This theory proposes that the <unk> of Ireland may have been the culmination of a long process of social and economic interaction between Ireland, Britain and adjacent parts of Continental Europe. 
<|endoftext|> The theory was advanced in part because of lack of archeological evidence for large @-@ scale Celtic immigration, though it is accepted that such movements are notoriously difficult to identify. Some proponents of this theory hold that it is likely that there was migration of smaller groups of Celts to Ireland, with sufficiently regular traffic to constitute a " migration stream, " but that this was not the fundamental cause of Insular <unk>. Historical linguists are <unk> that this method alone could account for the absorption of the Celtic language, with some saying that an assumed processional view of Celtic linguistic formation is'an especially hazardous exercise '. Genetic lineage investigation into the area of Celtic migration to Ireland has led to findings that showed no significant differences in mitochondrial DNA between Ireland and large areas of continental Europe, in contrast to parts of the Y @-@ chromosome pattern. When taking both into account a recent study drew the conclusion that modern Celtic speakers in Ireland could be thought of as European " Atlantic Celts " showing a shared ancestry throughout the Atlantic zone from northern Iberia to western Scandinavia rather than substantially central European.

Ptolemy in his <unk> refers to Ireland as <unk> <unk> ( Little Britain ), in contrast to the larger island, which he called <unk> <unk> ( Great Britain ). In his later work, Geography, Ptolemy refers to Ireland as <unk> and to Great Britain as Albion. These " new " names were likely to have been the local names for the islands at the time. The earlier names, in contrast, were likely to have been coined before direct contact with local peoples was made. 
<|endoftext|> The Romans would later refer to Ireland by this name too in its <unk> form, <unk>, or Scotia. Ptolemy records sixteen nations inhabiting every part of Ireland in 100 AD. The relationship between the Roman Empire and the kingdoms of ancient Ireland is unclear. However, a number of finds of Roman coins have been made, for example at the Iron Age settlement of <unk> Hill near <unk> and <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Ireland continued as a <unk> of rival kingdoms but, beginning in the 7th century AD, a concept of national kingship gradually became articulated through the concept of a High King of Ireland. Medieval Irish literature portrays an almost unbroken sequence of High Kings stretching back thousands of years but modern historians believe the scheme was constructed in the 8th century to justify the status of powerful political groupings by projecting the origins of their rule into the remote past. 
<|endoftext|> The High King was said to <unk> over the provincial kingdoms that together formed Ireland. All of these kingdoms had their own kings but were at least nominally subject to the High King. The High King was drawn from the ranks of the provincial kings and ruled also the royal kingdom of Meath, with a ceremonial capital at the Hill of Tara. The concept only became a political reality in the Viking Age and even then was not a consistent one. Ireland did have a culturally <unk> rule of law : the early written judicial system, the

A few months after selling his first set in 1938, DuMont opened his own New York area experimental television station ( <unk> ) in <unk>, New Jersey. In 1940, the station moved to Manhattan as <unk> on channel 4.

On May 19, 1945, DuMont opened experimental W3XWT in Washington, DC. A minority shareholder in DuMont Laboratories was Paramount Pictures, which had advanced $ 400 @,@ 000 in 1939 for a 40 % share in the company. Paramount had television interests of its own, having launched experimental stations in Los Angeles in 1939 and Chicago in 1940, and DuMont's association with Paramount ultimately proved to be a mistake.

Regular network service began on August 15, 1946, on WABD and W3XWT. In 1947, W3XWT became WTTG, named after Goldsmith. The pair were joined in 1949 by WDTV ( channel 3 ) in Pittsburgh.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Several poems from Yoko Ono's 1964 book <unk> inspired Lennon to write the lyrics for " Imagine " — in particular, one which Capitol Records reproduced on the back cover of the original Imagine LP titled " Cloud Piece ", reads : " Imagine the clouds dripping, dig a hole in your garden to put them in. " Lennon later said the composition " should be credited as a Lennon / Ono song. A lot of it — the lyric and the concept — came from Yoko, but in those days I was a bit more selfish, a bit more <unk>, and I sort of omitted her contribution, but it was right out of <unk>. " When asked about the song's meaning during a December 1980 interview with David <unk> for Playboy magazine, Lennon told <unk> that Dick Gregory had given Ono and him a Christian prayer book, which inspired him the concept behind " Imagine ". 
<|endoftext|> The concept of positive prayer... If you can imagine a world at peace, with no denominations of religion — not without religion but without this my God @-@ is @-@ bigger @-@ than @-@ your @-@ God thing — then it can be true... the World Church called me once and asked, " Can we use the lyrics to'Imagine'and just change it to'Imagine one religion '? " That showed [ me ] they didn 't understand it at all. It would defeat the whole purpose of the song, the whole idea. 
<|endoftext|> With the combined influence of " Cloud Piece " and the prayer book given to him by Gregory, Lennon wrote what author John Blaney described as " a humanistic <unk> for the people ". Blaney wrote, " Lennon contends that global harmony is within our reach, but only if we reject the mechanisms of social control that restrict human potential. " In the opinion of Blaney, with " Imagine ", Lennon attempted to raise people's awareness of their interaction with the institutions that affect their lives. Rolling Stone's David Fricke commented : " [ Lennon ] calls for a unity and equality built upon the complete elimination of modern social order : <unk> borders, organised religion, [ and ] economic class. " 
<|endoftext|> Lennon stated : "'Imagine ', which says :'Imagine that there was no more religion, no more country, no more politics,'is virtually the Communist manifesto, even though I'm not particularly a Communist and I do not belong to any movement. " He told NME : " There is no real Communist state in the world ; you must realize that. The Socialism I speak about... [ is ] not the way some <unk> Russian might do it, or the Chinese might do it. That might suit them. Us, we should have a nice... British Socialism. " Ono described the lyrical statement of " Imagine " as " just what John believed : that we are all one country, one world, one people. " Rolling Stone described its lyrics as " 22 lines of graceful, plain @-@ spoken faith in the power of a world, united in purpose, to repair and change itself ". 
<|endoftext|> Lennon composed " Imagine " one morning in early 1971, on a <unk> piano, in a bedroom at his Tittenhurst Park estate in Ascot, Berkshire, England. Ono watched as he composed the melody, chord structure and almost all the lyrics, nearly completing the song in one brief writing session.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In 1964, the political establishment in South Vietnam was still in turmoil. Following the coup that ousted Ngô Đình Diệm, the military situation quickly worsened as the National Liberation Front ( NLF, also known as Viet Cong ) gained significant ground in the countryside because the Military Revolutionary Council which governed South Vietnam, lacked direction both in terms of policy and planning. Furthermore, General Dương Văn Minh, as the Chairman of the Military Revolutionary Council, and his civilian Prime Minister Nguyễn <unk> <unk> favoured a political resolution instead of using military force, which brought them into conflict with the United States over the best strategy to end the Communist threat in South Vietnam. As a result, both men became increasingly unpopular among the military generals who held real political power in Saigon. On January 30, 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh successfully ousted Dương Văn Minh from the Military Revolutionary Council without firing a single shot. For much of the year, Khánh spent most of his efforts on consolidating political power, instead of fighting the Viet Cong. 
<|endoftext|> In contrast to the political unrest in Saigon, the Communist leadership in North Vietnam were far more concerned about the best strategy to fight the South Vietnamese government and their American supporters. While all leaders in Hanoi shared the same goal of eventual <unk> of their homeland, different factions within the Communist Party disagreed on the best method to achieve their desired goal. Members of North Vietnam's Politburo were divided by the issues surrounding the Soviet strategy of peaceful co @-@ existence versus the Chinese strategy of supporting national liberation movements in emerging countries. Despite their differences of opinion, the Communist Party leadership ultimately made preparations for armed struggle in South Vietnam. From Hanoi's perspective, the military regime in Saigon was able to hold out because the Communist main forces were still not ready to fight a conventional war, so North Vietnam must focus on the development of its military force in the shortest period of time. In the meantime, however, the war must be kept at its current level in order to prevent the full involvement of the United States military. 
<|endoftext|> On October 11, 1964, the National Liberation Front in South Vietnam was ordered to carry out a series of military operations as part of the Communist winter @-@ spring offensive. The NLF <unk> Bo ( Mekong Delta ) Regional Command established a sub @-@ command under the leadership of Trần Đình Xu, with Nguyễn <unk> as the deputy commander, and Lê <unk> Tấn as the political <unk>. Their mission was to inflict damage on the regular units of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam ( ARVN ) and destroy the strategic hamlets constructed by the former Ngô Đình Diệm regime. The National Liberation Front in South Vietnam identified the regions of Bình Long @-@ Phước Long and Bà Rịa @-@ Long Khánh, along Route 14, as the main targets for their offensive. Meanwhile, the Central Military Commission in Hanoi appointed General Nguyen Chi Thanh as the commander of North Vietnamese military operations in southern Vietnam.

At <unk>, Brian Knobbs defeated all members of 3 Count to win the Hardcore Championship. During a match, Helms suffered a broken nose, and was sidelined while he recovered. Upon his return, Tank Abbott had been added to the group, as a fan, and was utilized in an <unk> role. 3 Count had a long @-@ running feud ( scripted rivalry ) with The Jung Dragons, with the Dragons attempting to steal 3 Count's fictional recording contract. This led to a ladder match between the two teams at New Blood Rising, which 3 Count won due to Abbott's interference. As a result, Abbott claimed that he should be the lead singer of 3 Count, and was kicked out by the other three members, leading to a feud. 
<|endoftext|> 3 Count later disbanded as Moore and Helms kicked Karagias out of the group for attempting to steal the spotlight. At the same time, the Jung Dragons turned on Jamie Noble, who formed a team with Karagias. The three teams met in a Triangle match at <unk>, which 3 Count won. They also wrestled each other in a number one <unk> ladder match at <unk>, to earn a WCW Cruiserweight Championship match, in which both Moore and Helms grabbed the contract at the same time.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In 1964, weak @-@ hearted attempts at peaceful negotiation by FRELIMO were abandoned and, on September 25, 1964, Eduardo Mondlane began to launch guerrilla attacks on targets in northern Mozambique from his base in Tanzania. FRELIMO soldiers, with logistical assistance from the local population, attacked the administrative post at Chai Chai in the province of Cabo <unk>. FRELIMO militants were able to evade pursuit and surveillance by employing classic guerrilla tactics : <unk> patrols, <unk> communication and railroad lines, and making hit @-@ and @-@ run attacks against colonial outposts before rapidly fading into accessible <unk> areas. The insurgents were typically armed with rifles and machine pistols, and the attackers took full advantage of the monsoon season in order to evade pursuit. 
<|endoftext|> During heavy rains, it was much more difficult to track insurgents by air, <unk> Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, were able to flee into the bush ( the <unk> ) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines. 
<|endoftext|> With the initial FRELIMO attacks in Chai Chai, the fighting spread to Niassa and Tete at the centre of Mozambique. During the early stages of the conflict, FRELIMO activity was reduced to small, platoon @-@ sized engagements, <unk> and raids on Portuguese installations. The FRELIMO soldiers often operated in small groups of ten to fifteen soldiers. The scattered nature of FRELIMO's initial attacks was an attempt to disperse the Portuguese forces. 
<|endoftext|> The Portuguese troops began to suffer losses in November, fighting in the northern region of <unk>. With increasing support from the populace, and the low number of Portuguese regular troops, FRELIMO was quickly able to advance south towards <unk> and <unk>, linking to Tete with the aid of forces from the neighbouring Republic of Malawi, which had become a fully independent member of the Commonwealth of Nations on July 6, 1964. Despite the increasing range of FRELIMO operations, attacks were still limited to small strike teams attacking lightly defended administrative outposts, with the FRELIMO lines of communication and supply utilising canoes along the <unk> River and Lake Malawi. 
<|endoftext|> It was not until 1965 that recruitment of fighters increased along with popular support, and the strike teams were able to increase in size. The increase in popular support was in part due to FRELIMO agencies'offer of help to exiled Mozambicans, who had fled the conflict by travelling to nearby Tanzania. Like similar conflicts against the French and United States forces in Vietnam, the insurgents also used landmines to a great extent to <unk> the Portuguese forces, thus straining the armed forces'infrastructure and <unk> soldiers. 
<|endoftext|> FRELIMO attack groups had also begun to grow in size to include over 100 soldiers in certain cases, and the insurgents also began to accept women fighters into their ranks. On either October 10 or October 11, 1966, on returning to Tanzania after inspecting the front lines, <unk> Samuel <unk> was shot dead by Lourenço <unk>, a fellow FRELIMO guerrilla who was said to be in the employ of the Portuguese. 
<|endoftext|> One seventh of the population and one fifth of the territory were in FRELIMO hands by 1967 ; at this time there were approximately 8000 guerrillas in combat. During this period, Mondlane urged further expansion of the war effort, but also sought to retain the small strike groups. With the increasing cost of supply, more and more territory liberated from the Portuguese, and the adoption of measures to win the support of the population, it was at this time that Mondlane sought assistance from abroad, specifically the Soviet Union and China ; from these benefactors, he obtained large @-@ calibre machine guns, anti @-@ aircraft rifles and 75 mm recoilless rifles and 122 mm rockets.

<|endoftext|> Somerset promoted four players from their academy for the 2009 season, giving contracts to Jos Buttler, Adam <unk>, Chris Jones and James Burke. Of these, only Buttler appeared in the first @-@ team during the season. They also signed David Stiff, a fast bowler capped at Under @-@ 19 level for England, on a two @-@ month contract at the beginning of the season, which was later extended to the end of the season. Ian Blackwell, captain of the side in 2005 and 2006, left for Durham after coach Andy <unk> and captain Justin Langer made it clear that they regarded fitness as a priority. John Francis and Keith Parsons both retired at the end of 2008, Francis cited lack of first @-@ team opportunities for his departure, while at the age of 35, Parsons declared that : " There comes a time when your body tells you it's time to pack in professional sport.

<|endoftext|> In his preview of the 2009 season for ESPNcricinfo, Andrew McGlashan identified Somerset's opening partnerships with bat and ball as their main strengths, but predicted that the middle order would struggle to make an impact in the County Championship, stating that " none [ of the middle order ] jump out as potential match @-@ winners in four @-@ day cricket. " He speculated that the team's best chance of success would come in the one @-@ day competitions. The Daily Telegraph provided a more positive outlook, claiming that the county had " enough depth in batting and seam bowling to challenge [ for the County Championship ] again. " They identified spin bowling as an area of weakness following the departure of Blackwell. Bob Willis, writing in The Guardian, shared this view, and predicted that Somerset would also be hindered by the difficulty of getting 20 wickets at home, resulting in too many draws.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Although Marcus Trescothick had a season which David Foot described as " <unk> assured ", Somerset failed to win enough matches to pose a real challenge in the 2009 County Championship. The flat pitch at the County Ground, Taunton did not help their efforts ; the imbalance in favour of the batsmen meant that all but one match at the ground was drawn. Sussex's total of <unk> / 5 declared was the fifteenth highest total in the history of the County Championship, while Murray Goodwin's innings of 344 not out in that match was the sixth highest score by a batsman in the history of the competition. In total, six of Somerset's eight home matches contained scores of 500 or over in a single innings. In contrast, 500 was reached in only one of their away matches, by Hampshire at The Rose Bowl. The home conditions helped three of Somerset's batsmen pass 1 @,@ 000 first @-@ class runs in the season, including Craig Kieswetter and <unk> <unk>, who were both awarded their county caps after passing the landmark. Trescothick's 1 @,@ <unk> runs were the most by any batsman in the 2009 competition, finishing over 200 runs ahead of the next most prolific batsman, and he was named as both PCA Player of the Year and the PCA's Most Valuable Player of the Year for 2009. He was also selected as part of the team of the year, along with wicket @-@ keeper Kieswetter. 
<|endoftext|> In contrast to the strong batting line @-@ up, Foot suggested that Somerset " lacked a seam bowler to compensate for Andrew Caddick's withdrawal ". Caddick — who made his first @-@ class debut for Somerset in 1991 — only played five matches in 2009, and announced his intention to retire at the end of the season. He took ten wickets in 2009, and finished his career as Somerset's sixth highest wicket @-@ taker of all @-@ time.

During his period of living in exile he had few sources of income and little opportunity of getting his own works performed. The success of Le prophète sent Wagner over the edge, and he was also deeply envious of Meyerbeer's wealth. In reaction he published, under a pseudonym, his 1850 essay'Jewishness in Music '. Without specifically naming Meyerbeer, he interpreted the popular success of the latter as the <unk> of German music by alleged Jewish <unk> and willingness to cater to the lowest tastes, and attributed the supposed poor quality of such'Jewish music'to Jewish speech and song patterns, which'though the cultured son of <unk> takes <unk> pains to strip them off, nevertheless they <unk> an <unk> <unk> in <unk> to him '. 
<|endoftext|> In his major theoretical statement,'Opera and Drama'( 1852 ), Wagner objected to the music of Meyerbeer, asserting its <unk> and <unk> in dramatic terms ; this work contains Wagner's well @-@ known put @-@ down of Meyerbeer's operas as'effects without causes '.

This version was under Wagner's own name – and as Wagner had by now a far greater reputation, his views obtained far wider publicity. These attacks on Meyerbeer ( which also included <unk> at Felix Mendelssohn ) are regarded by Paul Lawrence Rose as a significant milestone in the growth of German anti @-@ Semitism. 
<|endoftext|> As Wagner prospered, it became second @-@ nature for him, his wife <unk> and the Wagner circle to <unk> Meyerbeer and his works, and <unk>'s <unk> contain numerous instances of this – ( as well as recording a dream of Wagner's in which he and Meyerbeer were reconciled ). Wagner's autobiography'Mein <unk> ', circulated amongst his friends ( and published openly in 1911 ), contains constant sniping at Meyerbeer and concludes with Wagner <unk> over Meyerbeer's death. The <unk> of Meyerbeer became a commonplace amongst <unk> : in 1898, George Bernard Shaw, in The Perfect <unk>, commented that " <unk> young people cannot understand how anyone could have taken Meyerbeer's influence seriously. " 
<|endoftext|> Thus as Wagner's stock rose, Meyerbeer's fell. In 1890, the year before the Paris premiere of Wagner's Lohengrin, there were no Wagner performances at the Paris Opéra, and 32 performances of Meyerbeer's four grand operas. In 1909, there were 60 Wagner performances, and only three of Meyerbeer ( Les Huguenots being the sole work performed ). 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = <unk> = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Meyerbeer's costly operas, requiring grand casts of leading singers, were gradually dropped from the repertoire in the early 20th century. They were banned in Germany from 1933, and subsequently in subject countries, by the Nazi regime because the composer was Jewish, and this was a major factor in their further disappearance from the repertory. 
<|endoftext|> One of the first serious post @-@ war studies of Meyerbeer and grand opera was <unk>'s 1948 book Grand Opera : An Art and a Business which laid out the themes and standards for much subsequent research. A major contribution to revival of interest in Meyerbeer was the work of the scholar Heinz Becker, leading to the complete publication, between 1960 and 2006, of Meyerbeer's complete diaries and correspondence in German, which are an important source for musical history of the era. The English scholar Robert <unk> has translated the diaries and undertaken a wide range of Meyerbeer studies. Not least, the establishment of a'Meyerbeer Fan Club'in America has stimulated interest. 
<|endoftext|> Most importantly the operas themselves are now beginning to be revived and recorded, although despite the efforts of such champions as Dame Joan Sutherland, who took part in performances of, and recorded, Les Huguenots, they have yet to achieve anything like the huge popular following they attracted during their creator's lifetime. Recordings are now available of all the operas from Il crociato onwards, for many of the earlier Italian operas, and for other pieces including his songs and the incidental music for Struensee.

Using so large aircraft on the short @-@ haul flights in Southern Norway gave little economy @-@ of @-@ scale, and the airline seldom needed the increased capacity.

The <unk> were released to real estate developers who used them in their advertisements, and Wright and the USDA were pressed by the real estate industry to publicize the report as quickly as possible. Wright's supervisor noted errors in the report, as well as undue enthusiasm for draining, and delayed its release in 1910. Different unofficial versions of the report circulated — some that had been altered by real estate interests — and a version hastily put together by Senator Duncan U. Fletcher called U.S. Senate <unk> 89 included early <unk> statements, causing a <unk> of speculation. 
<|endoftext|> Wright's initial report concluded that drainage would not be difficult. Building canals would be more cost effective than constructing a dike around Lake Okeechobee. The soil would be fertile after drainage, the climate would not be adversely affected, and the enormous lake would be able to <unk> farmland in the dry season. Wright based his conclusions on 15 years of weather data since the recording of precipitation began in the 1890s. His calculations concentrated on the towns of Jupiter and Kissimmee. Since weather data had not been recorded for any area within the Everglades, none was included in the report. Furthermore, the heaviest year of rain on record, Wright assumed, was atypical, and he urged that canals should not be constructed to bear that amount of water due to the expense. Wright's calculations for what canals should be able to hold were off by 55 percent. His most fundamental mistake, however, was designing the canals for a maximum rainfall of 4 inches ( 10 cm ) of water a day, based on flawed data for July and August rainfall, despite available data that indicated torrential <unk> of 10 inches ( 25 cm ) and 12 inches ( 30 cm ) had occurred in 24 @-@ hour periods. 
<|endoftext|> Though a few voices expressed skepticism of the report's conclusions — notably Frank Stoneman, the editor of the Miami News @-@ Record ( the forerunner of The Miami Herald ) — the report was hailed as <unk>, coming from a branch of the U.S. government. In 1912 Florida appointed Wright to oversee the drainage, and the real estate industry <unk> misrepresented this mid @-@ level engineer as the world's foremost authority on wetlands drainage, in charge of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation. However, the U.S. House of Representatives investigated Wright since no report had officially been published despite the money paid for it. Wright eventually retired when it was discovered that his colleagues disagreed with his conclusions and refused to approve the report's publication. One testified at the hearings : " I regard Mr. Wright as absolutely and completely incompetent for any engineering work ". 
<|endoftext|> Governor Broward ran for the U.S. Senate in 1908 but lost. Broward and his predecessor, William Jennings, were paid by Richard <unk> to tour the state to promote drainage. Broward was elected to the Senate in 1910, but died before he could take office. He was <unk> across Florida for his leadership and progressive inspiration. Rapidly growing Fort Lauderdale paid him tribute by naming Broward County after him ( the town's original plan had been to name it Everglades County ). Land in the Everglades was being sold for $ 15 an acre a month after Broward died. Meanwhile, Henry Flagler continued to build railway stations at towns as soon as the populations warranted them. News of the Panama Canal inspired him to connect his rail line to the closest deep water port. Biscayne Bay was too shallow, so Flagler sent railway scouts to explore the possibility of building the line through to the tip of mainland Florida. The scouts reported that not enough land was present to build through the Everglades, so Flagler instead changed the plan to build to Key West in 1912.

<|endoftext|> Throughout the mid and late 1990s, Fowler was widely considered to be the most natural finisher playing in England. Fowler sealed this reputation as he scored more than 30 goals for three consecutive seasons, up to 1997. He remains the only player to have scored 30 plus goals in his first three full seasons in England scoring 98 goals with a total of 116 in 3 and a half years, something which has also yet to be beaten in La Liga, <unk> A and the <unk> too. Fowler's partnership with Steve McManaman was largely described as the reason why Liverpool had become the club known for being the most potent attacking force in England at the time, and Fowler was renowned for scoring goals of all varieties, from every angle and distance, with McManaman describing him as the " greatest goalscorer of all time. " 
<|endoftext|> Stan Collymore, Fowler's strike partner from 1995 to 1997, said in his autobiography that Fowler was the best player he has ever played alongside. Fowler and Collymore were among the most prolific goal @-@ scoring strike partnerships in England during the 1995 – 96 season. In the same season he scored twice in a 4 – 3 victory over Newcastle United, a match voted the best of the decade in a Premier League poll. The match helped prevent Newcastle from winning the league, but it was not enough for Liverpool to clinch the title ; they finished third while Manchester United were crowned champions. Fowler also played in his first FA Cup final that season, but was on the losing side as Manchester United won 1 – 0. 
<|endoftext|> Fowler received a call @-@ up to the full England squad and won his first cap on 27 March 1996 as a substitute in a friendly against Bulgaria.

This meant he reached a century of goals one game quicker than his first strike partner, Ian Rush, in just 165 games.

<|endoftext|> their day ( newspapers at the time gave many column inches each day to the <unk> of the upper classes ) – were as much a crowd @-@ <unk> as the political speakers, and Rosebery's planning used that to full effect. One meeting was so packed that many were <unk> : 70 @,@ 000 people applied for tickets in a hall capable of holding 6 @,@ 500. Lady Rosebery reported, " I had never heard Archie ( Lord Rosebery ) speak in public politically before, but after the first minute I felt I could never be nervous at his making a speech the audience show him great affection. " [ sic ] However it was not just Gladstone and Rosebery the huge crowds had come to see, but also the <unk> supporting and smiling families. Lady Rosebery went on to describe how " They ( the crowds ) <unk> me on the back till my shoulders were sensitive. " Thus in Rosebery's first serious involvement in politics, Disraeli was defeated and the newly elected MP for Midlothian became Prime Minister for the second time ( the caretaker liberal leader Lord Hartington retired in favour of Gladstone ). It was also obvious that Lady Rosebery was a very evident and valuable political <unk> asset. As the Marquess of Crewe put it " she had cut her spurs. " 
<|endoftext|> Her political <unk> and ambitions for her husband were however to be more severely tested following the Liberal victory. Rosebery was, as expected, offered a position in Government by Gladstone. It had been rumoured that the position of Viceroy of Ireland or a cabinet place would be <unk>, but it turned out to be the job of Under Secretary of the India Office. Rosebery immediately declined the post, giving as his reason that it would appear that he was being repaid for running Gladstone's campaign ( as though the <unk> position would not ). When pressed further he cited ill health — he had been suffering from scarlet fever during the Midlothian campaign and now also appeared to be suffering a minor nervous breakdown. Political leaders urged Lady Rosebery to influence him, but she defended his decision, while stressing that his deterioration in health was only temporary. She had to be careful — if it appeared her husband had declined the offer on the grounds that it was too <unk>, it would give substance to the claims being made that he was <unk> and <unk>. Whatever the truth, and it may be Rosebery's own explanation that he " disliked hard work, " Lady Rosebery continued to <unk> Gladstone for a job for Rosebery within the cabinet. In August 1880, when Gladstone told her firmly that " There is nothing I can give him, " she claimed she had not been seeking a cabinet post and Gladstone had misunderstood her. At the same time she was <unk> enough to mention that Sir William Harcourt and Sir Charles Dilke, both radicals opposed to Gladstone's policies, were " visiting them " and " thoughtful. " Lady Rosebery also began to befriend those politicians such as Lord <unk> who <unk> with her husband, while others such as Lord Granville and Lord Hartington she identified as aloof. She dismissed Lord Spencer with " I can never look on him as a great motive power, besides he does not mention Archie [ Rosebery ] to me. " This was the same Lord Spencer who had advised the Prince and Princess of Wales against visiting the homes of wealthy Jews. 
<|endoftext|> Finally her soliciting paid off and in 1881, Rosebery was offered a government position acceptable to him, that of Under Secretary at the Home Office with special responsibility for Scotland. He had sought the position feeling that Scotland was neglected by the Liberal Government who were more interested in Ireland. However, immediately upon assuming the job he began to demand a place in the cabinet. The office he sought was that of Lord Privy Seal, a position Gladstone refused on account of Rosebery's inexperience in Government. It appeared that Rosebery was showing his true colours and he was accused of <unk> like a <unk> child, with doubts cast over the <unk> of his reasons for refusing the Under <unk> of the India Office. Lady Rosebery, " conscious of her husband's supreme ability, " wanted him in the cabinet and was furiously <unk> her husband's discontent until Rosebery threatened to resign his Home Office position. Lady Rosebery had an angry row with Gladstone's wife, where Mrs Gladstone pointed out that if Rosebery resigned he would have nothing but horse racing to interest him, and that Lady Rosebery should be patient as her husband was young. Rosebery, accepting that a cabinet place was not going to be forthcoming, resigned from Government. Lady Rosebery, realising further appeal to the <unk> was pointless, tried a new <unk> — Lord Hartington, the immensely influential

Wheeler had been suggested for the job by Archibald Wavell, the Viceroy of India, who had been acting on the recommendations of the archaeologist Leonard Woolley, who had authored a report lamenting the state of the archaeological establishment in the British @-@ controlled subcontinent. Wheeler recognised this state of affairs, in a letter to a friend complaining about the lack of finances and equipment, commenting that " We're back in 1850 ". He initially found much to dislike in India, and in his letters to friends in Britain expressed derogatory and racist sentiments toward Indians : he stated that " they feed wrongly and think wrongly and live wrongly... I already find myself regarding them as ill @-@ made clockwork toys rather than as human beings, and I find myself bullying them most brutally. " He expelled those staff members whom he deemed too idle, and physically beat others in an attempt to motivate them. 
<|endoftext|> From the beginning of his tenure, he sought to distance himself from previous Director @-@ Generals and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors. <unk> with a four @-@ year contract, Wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from Britain, Glyn Daniel and Stuart Piggott, to aid him in reforming the Archaeological Survey, although they declined the offer. He then toured the subcontinent, seeking to meet all of the Survey's staff members. He had drawn up a <unk> containing research questions that he wanted the Survey to focus on ; these included understanding the period between the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization and the Achaemenid Empire, discerning the socio @-@ cultural background to the <unk>, dating the <unk> invasion, and establishing a dating system for southern India prior to the sixth century CE.

Throughout his period in India, his students were some of the only individuals to whom Wheeler warmed ; more widely, he was annoyed by what he saw as the idleness, incompetence and corruption of Indian society. Initially focusing on the northwest of the subcontinent, Wheeler was particularly fascinated by the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization. On his initial inspection of the Indus Valley sites of Mohenjo @-@ daro and Harappa, he organised a very brief excavation which revealed fortifications around both settlements. He later led a more detailed excavation at Harappa, where he exposed further fortifications and established a <unk> for the settlement.

It has since been alleged that while Wheeler took credit for discovering the significance of this site, it had previously been established by A. <unk>, the Superintendent of the Government Museum in Madras, and the French archaeologist <unk> Dubreuil, with Wheeler intentionally ignoring their contribution. He later undertook excavations of six megalithic tombs in <unk>, Mysore, which enabled him to gain a chronology for the archaeology of much of southern India.

It is often difficult to decide the country of creation of others, as work in international styles was produced in Scotland, along with pieces retaining more distinctive local styles.

The <unk> and Fife <unk> are very similar and were probably made by the same workshop around 1500, as boxes for <unk> such as jewellery or documents. The overall form of the <unk> follows French examples, and the locks and metal bands are decorated in Gothic style with " simple decorations of <unk> and <unk> egg and dart " while the whalebone panels are carved in relief with a late form of Insular interwoven <unk> characteristic of late Medieval West Scotland.

A few significant reliquaries survive from West Scotland, examples of the habit of the Celtic church of treating the possessions rather than the bones of saints as relics. As in Irish examples these were partly reworked and elaborated at intervals over a long period.

Savery's several later dodo images all show greyish birds, possibly because he had by then seen a normal specimen. Cheke and Hume concluded the painted specimen was white due to albinism, and that this peculiar feature was the reason it was collected from Mauritius and brought to Europe. <unk> de <unk> instead suggested that the light plumage was a juvenile trait, a result of <unk> of old <unk> specimens, or simply due to artistic license. 
<|endoftext|> No fossil remains of dodo @-@ like birds have ever been found on Réunion. A few later sources take issue with the proposed ibis @-@ identity of the solitaire, and have even regarded the " white dodo " as a valid species. British writer Errol Fuller agrees that the 17th @-@ century paintings do not depict Réunion birds, but has questioned whether the ibis subfossils are necessarily connected to the solitaire accounts. He notes that no evidence indicates the extinct ibis survived until the time Europeans reached Réunion. Cheke and Hume have dismissed such sentiments as being mere " belief " and " hope " in the existence of a dodo on the island. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Evolution = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The volcanic island of Réunion is only three million years old, whereas Mauritius and Rodrigues, with each their flightless <unk> species, are eight to ten million years old, and it is unlikely that either bird would have been capable of flying after five or more million years of adapting to the islands. Therefore, it is unlikely that Réunion could have been colonised by flightless birds from these islands, and only flighted species on the island have relatives there. Three million years is enough time for flightless and weak flying abilities to have evolved in bird species on Réunion itself. But such species would have been wiped out by the eruption of the volcano <unk> des <unk> between 300 @,@ 000 and 180 @,@ 000 years ago. Most recent species would therefore likely be descendants of animals which had <unk> the island from Africa or Madagascar after this event, which is not enough time for a bird to become flightless. 
<|endoftext|> In 1995, morphological study suggested the closest extant relatives of the Réunion ibis are the African sacred ibis ( T. <unk> ) of Africa and the straw @-@ necked ibis ( T. <unk> ) of Australia. It has also been suggested that it was closest to the <unk> sacred ibis ( T. <unk> ), and therefore of ultimately African origin. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Description = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Contemporary accounts described the species as having white and grey plumage merging into yellow, black wing tips and tail feathers, a long neck and legs, and limited flight capabilities. Sieur Dubois'1674 account is the most detailed contemporary description of the bird, here as translated by Hugh Strickland in 1848 : 
<|endoftext|> <unk>. These birds are so called because they always go alone. They are the size of a large Goose, and are white, with the tips of the wings and tail black. The tail feathers resemble those of an <unk> ; the neck is long, and the beak is like that of a <unk>, but larger ; the legs and feet like those of <unk>. This bird has recourse to running, as it flies but very little. 
<|endoftext|> The plumage colouration mentioned is similar to that of the related African sacred ibis and straw @-@ necked ibis, which are also mainly white and glossy black. In the reproductive season, the ornamental feathers on the back and wing tips of the African sacred ibis look similar to the feathers of an ostrich, which echoes Dubois'description. Likewise, a subfossil lower jaw found in 1994 showed that the bill of the Réunion ibis was relatively short and straight for an ibis, which corresponds with Dubois'<unk> comparison. Cheke and Hume have suggested that the French word ( <unk> ) from Dubois'original description, usually translated to " <unk> ", could also mean <unk>, another bird with a long, straight, but slightly more robust, bill. They have also pointed out that the last sentence is <unk>, and actually means the bird could be caught by running after it. The bright colouration of the plumage mentioned by some authors may refer to <unk>, as seen in the straw @-@ necked ibis.

<|endoftext|> In 1964, Wilhelm finished with career highs in both saves ( 27 ) and games pitched ( 73 ). His ERA decreased to 1 @.@ 99 that season ; it remained less than 2 @.@ 00 through the 1968 season. In 1965, Wilhelm contributed to another passed balls record when Chicago catcher J. C. Martin allowed 33 of them in one season. That total set a modern single @-@ season baseball record for the category. Wilhelm's career @-@ low ERA ( 1 @.@ 31 ) came in 1967, when he earned an 8 – 3 record for the White Sox with 12 saves. 
<|endoftext|> In the 1968 season, Wilhelm was getting close to breaking the all @-@ time games pitched record belonging to Cy Young ( <unk> games ). Chicago manager Eddie <unk> began to think about using Wilhelm as a starting pitcher for game number 907. However, the White Sox fired <unk> before the record came up. Wilhelm later broke the record as a relief pitcher. He also set MLB records for consecutive <unk> games by a pitcher, career victories in relief, games finished and innings pitched in relief. Despite Wilhelm's success, the White Sox, who had won at least 83 games per season in the 1960s, performed poorly. They finished 1968 with a 67 – 95 record. 
<|endoftext|> Wilhelm was noted during this period for his <unk> of relief pitcher Wilbur Wood, who came to the 1967 White Sox in a trade. Wood sometimes threw a knuckleball upon his arrival in Chicago, but Wilhelm encouraged him to throw it full @-@ time. By 1968, Wood won 13 games, saved 16 games and earned a 1 @.@ 87 ERA. He credited Wilhelm with helping him to master the knuckleball, as the White Sox coaches did not know much about how to throw it. Between 1968 and 1970, Wood pitched in more games ( 241 ) than any other pitcher and more innings ( 400 1 ⁄ 3 ) than any other relief pitcher. 
<|endoftext|> After the 1968 season, MLB expanded and an expansion draft was conducted in which the new teams could select certain players from the established teams. The White Sox left Wilhelm unprotected, possibly because they did not believe that teams would have interest in a much older pitcher. On October 15, 1968, Wilhelm was chosen in the expansion draft by the Kansas City Royals as the 49th pick. That offseason, he was traded by the Royals to the California Angels for Ed Kirkpatrick and Dennis <unk>.

He finished the 1969 season by pitching eight games for the Braves, earning four saves and recording a 0 @.@ 73 ERA over 12 1 ⁄ 3 innings pitched. Wilhelm spent most of the 1970 season with the Braves, pitching in 50 games for the team and earning ten saves. 
<|endoftext|> On September 21, 1970, Wilhelm was selected off waivers by the Chicago Cubs, for whom he appeared in three games. He was traded back by the Cubs to the Braves for Hal <unk> after the season. As the Cubs acquired Wilhelm late in the season to bolster their playoff contention, which was a source of controversy, Commissioner Bowie <unk> investigated the transaction. In December, <unk> ruled that he did not find evidence of <unk> associated with the transactions that sent Wilhelm to the Cubs and quickly back to the Braves. 
<|endoftext|> Wilhelm was released by the Braves on June 29, 1971, having pitched in three games for that year's Braves. He signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers on July 10, 1971. He appeared in nine MLB games for the Dodgers, giving up two earned runs in 17 2 ⁄ 3 innings. He also pitched in eight games that season for the team's Class AAA minor league affiliate, the Spokane Indians. He started six of those games and registered a 3 @.@ 89 ERA. He pitched in 16 games for the Dodgers in 1972, registering a 4 @.@ 62 ERA over 25 innings. The Dodgers released him on July 21, 1972. He never appeared in another game.

Increasingly interested in art, he decided to switch from classical studies to a course at UCL's art school, the <unk> School of Fine Art ; he returned to his previous subject after coming to the opinion that – in his words – he never became more than " a conventionally accomplished picture maker ". This interlude had adversely affected his classical studies, and he received a second class <unk> on graduating. 
<|endoftext|> Wheeler began studying for a Master of Arts degree in classical studies, which he attained in 1912. During this period, he also gained employment as the personal secretary of the UCL Provost Gregory Foster, although he later criticised Foster for transforming the university from " a college in the truly academic sense [ into ] a <unk> <unk> as little like a college as a <unk> is like a man ". It was also at this time of life that he met and began a relationship with Tessa <unk>, a student then studying history at UCL, when they were both serving on the committee of the University College Literary Society. 
<|endoftext|> During his studies, Wheeler had developed his love of archaeology, having joined an excavation of <unk> <unk>, a Romano @-@ British settlement in <unk>, in 1913.

Wheeler's proposed project had been to <unk> Romano @-@ Rhenish pottery, and with the grant he funded a trip to the Rhineland in Germany, there studying the Roman pottery housed in local museums ; his research into this subject was never published. 
<|endoftext|> At this period, there were very few jobs available within British archaeology ; as the later archaeologist Stuart Piggott related, " the young Wheeler was looking for a professional job where the profession had yet to be created.

It was during this period, in January 1915, that a son was born to the Wheelers, and named Michael. Michael was their only child, something that was a social anomaly at the time, although it is unknown if this was by choice or not. In May 1915, Wheeler transferred to the Royal Field Artillery ( Territorial Force ) and shortly thereafter was appointed captain. In this position he was stationed at various bases across Britain, often bringing his wife and child with him ; his responsibility was as a battery commander, initially of field guns and later of howitzers. 
<|endoftext|> In October 1917 Wheeler was posted to the 76th Army Field Artillery Brigade, one of the Royal Field Artillery brigades under the direct control of the General Officer Commanding, Third Army. The brigade was then stationed in Belgium, where it had been engaged in the Battle of Passchendaele against German troops along the Western Front. There, he was immediately placed in command of an artillery battery, replacing a major who had been poisoned by <unk> gas. Being promoted to the rank of acting major, he was part of the Left Group of artillery covering the advancing Allied infantry in the battle.

The German physician and naturalist Georg Heinrich von <unk> wrote the earliest published account on how to <unk> this mushroom in 1823.

The Oldham <unk> was the site of over 150 collieries during its recorded history.

This means Zhou was a local hero from Tangyin County, <unk> prefecture, Henan province ( the same area as Yue Fei ).

He would stay up all night reading military strategy books and idolized such great historical heroes as Guan Yu. However, the Yue family was much too poor to afford military lessons for their son, so, Yao <unk>, the boy's maternal grandfather, hired Chen <unk> ( <unk> ) to teach the eleven @-@ year @-@ old how to wield the Chinese spear. Yao was very surprised when his grandson quickly mastered the spear by the age of thirteen. Zhou was then brought in to continue Yue's military training in archery. Dr. Kaplan describes Zhou as the " most important " of the two teachers. 
<|endoftext|> A section of the Jin <unk> Xu <unk>, the second part of Yue Ke's original published memoir, describes one of Zhou's archery lessons and reveals that he took other children as his pupils : 
<|endoftext|> " One day, [ Chou ] T 'ung gathered his pupils for an archery session and to display his ability put three arrows in succession into the center of the target. Pointing to the target to show grandfather [ Yue Fei ], he said :'After you can perform like this, you can say you are an archer '. <unk>, thanked him and asked to be allowed to try. He drew his bow, let fly his arrow and struck the end of T 'ung's arrow. He shot again and again hit the mark. T 'ung was greatly amazed and subsequently presented to grandfather his two favorite bows. Thereafter grandfather practiced still more [ until ] he was able to shoot to the left and right, accurately letting fly the arrow as he moved. When he became a general he taught this to his officers and men so that his whole army became skilled at shooting to the left and right and frequently used this technique to crush the enemy's spirit ". 
<|endoftext|> The last sentence of the passage is similar to one from the Republican era Biography of Song Yue, Prince of E. But instead of teaching them his own technique, it states Yue taught what he had learned from Zhou to his soldiers who were victorious in battle.

Yue's father later followed him secretly to Zhou's tomb after striking him during an argument over his melancholic behavior. There, he saw him perform the unorthodox <unk> involving the meat, wine, and three arrows. When he finally confronted him, the son confessed that " his gratitude for Chou's instruction could not be <unk> simply by the usual first and middle of the month ceremonies and so he... shot off the three arrows to symbolize that Chou had been the source of his inspiration as an archer ". Dr. Kaplan's states this happened just prior to Yue's entrance into the army and that the entire event served as a symbol for Yue's " entrance into responsible <unk> ".

Early American, English, and other European typesetters'style guides ( also known as printers'rules ) specified spacing standards that were all essentially identical from the 18th century onwards. These guides — e.g., Jacobi in the UK ( 1890 ) and <unk>, <unk>, and De <unk> ( 1866 – 1901 ) in the U.S. — indicated that sentences should be em @-@ spaced, and that words should be 1 / 3 or 1 / 2 em @-@ spaced ( illustration right ). The relative size of the sentence spacing would vary depending on the size of the word spaces and the justification needs. For most countries, this remained the standard for published work until the 20th century. Yet, even in this period, there were publishing houses ( notably in France ) that used a standard word space between sentences — a technique called French spacing ( illustration below ).

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Mechanical type systems introduced near the end of the 19th century, such as the <unk> and <unk> machines, allowed for some variable sentence spacing similar to hand composition. Just as these machines revolutionized the mass production of text, the advent of the typewriter around the same time revolutionized the creation of personal and business documents. But the typewriters'mechanical limitations did not allow variable spacing — typists could only choose the number of times they pressed the space bar. <unk> in some English @-@ speaking countries initially learned to insert three spaces between sentences to approximate the wider sentence spacing used in traditional printing, but later settled on two spaces, a practice that continued throughout the 20th century.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In the early 20th century, some printers began using one and a half <unk> spaces ( an " en <unk> " ) to separate sentences. This standard continued in use, to some extent, into the 1990s. 
<|endoftext|> <unk>, newspapers, and books began to adopt the single space convention in the United States in the 1940s and in the United Kingdom in the 1950s. <unk> did not move to single spacing simultaneously. The average writer still relied on the typewriter to create text — with its inherent mechanical spacing limitations. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> advances began affecting sentence spacing methods. In 1941, IBM introduced the Executive, a typewriter capable of proportional spacing — which had been used in professional typesetting for hundreds of years. This innovation broke the hold that the monospaced font had on the typewriter — reducing the severity of its mechanical limitations. By the 1960s, electronic <unk> systems ignored runs of white space in text. This was also true of the World Wide Web, as HTML normally ignores additional spacing, although in 2011 the CSS 2 @.@ 1 standard officially added an option that can preserve additional spaces. In the 1980s, desktop publishing software provided the average writer with more advanced formatting tools.

Three prototypes were ordered with the company designation of B @-@ 48 and the informal name of " Firecrest ", but only two of them actually flew. The development of the aircraft was prolonged by significant design changes and slow deliveries of components, but the determination by the Ministry of Supply in 1946 that the airframe did not meet the requirements for a strike fighter doomed the aircraft. Construction of two of the prototypes was continued to gain flight @-@ test data and the third was allocated to strength testing. The two flying aircraft were sold back to Blackburn in 1950 for disposal and the other aircraft survived until 1952.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The Firebrand required significant effort by Blackburn to produce a useful aircraft and the first discussions on a redesign of the aircraft with a <unk> @-@ flow wing took place in September 1943. The new wing was estimated to reduce the weight of the wing by 700 lb ( <unk> kg ) and increase the aircraft speed by 13 mph ( 21 km / h ). The extent of redesign increased and this led to a new fuselage and other improvements. In October 1943, Blackburn's design staff, led by G.E. Petty, started work on this development of the Firebrand which led to Specification S.28 / 43 being issued by the Air Ministry on 26 February 1944 covering the new aircraft. The specification was designed around a Bristol Centaurus 77 radial engine with <unk> @-@ rotating propellers that allowed the size of the rudder to be reduced. 
<|endoftext|> The new design, given the company designation B @-@ 48, was known unofficially by Blackburn as the " Firecrest " but was always known by its specification number by the Air Ministry and Navy. It was a low @-@ winged, single @-@ seat, all @-@ metal <unk>. <unk> of the cockpit the fuselage was an oval @-@ shaped stressed @-@ skin semi @-@ <unk>, but forward it had a circular @-@ section, tubular @-@ steel frame. The cockpit of the Firecrest was moved forward and raised the pilot's position so that he now looked over the wing leading edge, and down the nose. The canopy was adapted from the Hawker Tempest fighter. In the rear fuselage was a single 52 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 240 l ; 62 US gal ) fuel tank with two 92 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 420 l ; 110 US gal ) fuel tanks in the centre wing section. The aircraft had a redesigned, thinner, inverted gull wing of <unk> flow <unk> section. The wing consisted of a two @-@ spar centre section with just over 6 @.@ 5 degrees of <unk> and outer panels with 9 degrees of dihedral. It could be <unk> folded in two places to allow more compact storage in the hangar decks of aircraft carriers. Four Fowler flaps were fitted to give good low @-@ speed handling for landing and the wing had retractable dive brakes on both surfaces. In the course of the redesign the structure was simplified which reduced weight by 1 @,@ 400 lb ( 635 kg ) and even after the fuel capacity was increased by 70 imperial gallons ( 320 l ; 84 US gal ) the gross weight was still 900 pounds ( 410 kg ) less than that of the Firebrand. 
<|endoftext|> Work on two prototypes was authorised in November 1943, but proposals for alternative engines delayed progress. In 1945, it was decided that as well as adding another Centaurus @-@ engined prototype, there should be three prototypes with the Napier E.122 ( a development of the Sabre ) as Specification S.10 / 45. The Ministry believed that this would enable Blackburn to develop their knowledge of <unk> and structural design and support the engine development at Napier. However, it was found that the S.10 / 45 aircraft could only be balanced if the E.122 <unk> was placed behind the pilot. The necessary redesign and 1 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 454 kg ) weight increase, coupled with the limited funds available to the Royal Navy, meant that it could no longer be justified and the S.10 / 45 was cancelled on 8 October. While in final design, the Centaurus 77 engine with <unk> @-@ rotating propellers was cancelled in January 1946 and a conventional 2 @,@ <unk> @-@ horsepower ( 2 @,@ 107 kW ) Centaurus 57 was substituted.

Levee 29 featured four flood control gates that controlled all the water entering Everglades National Park ; before construction, water flowed in through open drain pipes. The period from 1962 to 1965 was one of drought for the Everglades, and Levee 29 remained closed to allow the Biscayne <unk> — the fresh water source for South Florida — to stay filled. Animals began to cross Tamiami Trail for the water held in WCA 3, and many were killed by cars. <unk> estimate the population of alligators in Everglades National Park was <unk> ; otters nearly became extinct. The populations of wading birds had been reduced by 90 percent from the 1940s. When park management and the U.S. Department of the Interior asked the C & SF for assistance, the C & SF offered to build a levee along the southern border of Everglades National Park to retain waters that historically flowed through the <unk> and into Florida Bay. Though the C & SF refused to send the park more water, they constructed Canal 67, bordering the east side of the park and carrying excess water from Lake Okeechobee to the Atlantic.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The C & SF established 470 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 900 km2 ) for the Everglades Agricultural Area — 27 percent of the Everglades before development. In the late 1920s, agricultural experiments indicated that adding large amounts of <unk> sulfate to Everglades muck produced profitable vegetable <unk>. Adding 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) of the compound was more cost effective than adding 1 short ton ( 0 @.@ 91 t ) of <unk>. The primary cash crop in the EAA is sugarcane, though sod, beans, <unk>, <unk>, and rice are also grown. Sugarcane became more consolidated an industry than did any other crop ; in 1940 the coalition of farms was renamed U.S. Sugar and this produced 86 percent of Everglades sugar. During the 1930s the sugarcane farmers'coalition came under investigation for labor practices that bordered on slavery. Potential employees — primarily young black men — were lured from all over the U.S. by the promise of jobs, but they were held financially responsible for training, transportation, room and board and other costs. <unk> while debts were owed was punishable with jail time. By 1942, U.S. Sugar was indicted for <unk> in federal court, though the charges were eventually dismissed on a <unk>. U.S. Sugar benefited significantly from the U.S. embargo on Cuban goods beginning in the early 1960s. In 1958, before the Castro regime, 47 @,@ 000 acres ( 190 km2 ) of sugarcane were harvested in Florida ; by the 1964 – 1965 season, 228 @,@ 000 acres ( 920 km2 ) were harvested. From 1959 to 1962 the region went from two sugar mills to six, one of which in Belle Glade set several world records for sugar production. 
<|endoftext|> Fields in the EAA are typically 40 acres ( 16 ha ), on two sides bordered by canals that are connected to larger ones by which water is pumped in or out depending on the needs of the crops. The water level for sugarcane is ideally maintained at 20 inches ( 51 cm ) below the surface soil, and after the cane is harvested, the stalks are burned. <unk> require more <unk> than sugarcane, though the fields may resemble the historic hydrology of the Everglades by being flooded in the wet season. Sugarcane, however, requires water in the dry season. The fertilizers used on vegetables, along with high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus that are the by @-@ product of decayed soil necessary for sugarcane production, were pumped into WCAs south of the EAA, predominantly to Everglades National Park. The introduction of large amounts of these let exotic plants take hold in the Everglades.

The island's peninsulas radiate from a mountainous centre dominated by the <unk>, the rocky slopes of which provide some of the most dramatic mountain scenery in the country. Although it has been suggested that the Gaelic Sgitheanach describes a winged shape there is no definitive agreement as to the name's origins. 
<|endoftext|> The island has been occupied since the Mesolithic period and its history includes a time of Norse rule and a long period of domination by Clan MacLeod and Clan Donald. The 18th @-@ century <unk> <unk> led to the breaking up of the clan system and subsequent Clearances that replaced entire communities with sheep farms, some of which also involved forced <unk> to distant lands. <unk> numbers declined from over 20 @,@ 000 in the early 19th century to just under 9 @,@ 000 by the closing decade of the 20th century.

<|endoftext|> The main industries are tourism, agriculture, fishing and forestry. Skye is part of the Highland Council local government area.

Its frequency of appearance in the Appalachian Mountains of the United States has been described as " occasional to locally common ". Mycologist David Arora notes that in the United States, the species is found with ponderosa pine in Arizona, but is absent in California's ponderosa pine forests. It has also been collected from China, India, Guatemala, and Costa Rica ( in forests dominated by oak ). In Europe, it has so far only been found in southern France. A study on the seasonal appearance of fruiting bodies in the subtropical forests of <unk>, Mexico, confirmed that <unk> production coincided with the rainy season between June and September. 
<|endoftext|> L. indigo is a mycorrhizal fungus, and as such, establishes a mutualistic relationship with the roots of certain trees ( " hosts " ), in which the fungi exchange minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for fixed carbon from the host. The subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the rootlets of a broad range of tree species, forming so @-@ called ectomycorrhizae — an intimate association that is especially beneficial to the host, as the fungus produces enzymes that <unk> organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree. 
<|endoftext|> Reflecting their close relationships with trees, the fruit bodies of L. indigo are typically found growing on the ground, scattered or in groups, in both deciduous and coniferous forests.

<|endoftext|> Reviewers were especially pleased with the emotional experience of playing the game, particularly with other players. Christian Donlan of Eurogamer described it as a " non @-@ denominational religious experience " that, with the addition of another player, moves beyond metaphors and becomes a " pilgrimage " to the player. A reviewer writing for Edge magazine said the emotional arc of the game hits with " occasionally startling power ", while Patrick Shaw from Wired said the game made him feel a " wide range of emotions... wonder, fear, even sadness. " Miller said all three times he played the game, " each time, without fail, individual moments... managed to give me <unk>, and those moments have remained on my mind for weeks afterward. " Joel Gregory of PlayStation Official Magazine praised the game's story for being open to the player's interpretation, leaving an ambiguity that drew him in. The addition of an unnamed second player was described by Donlan as brilliant and as a " master stroke ", and Edge said it made for " a more absorbing, more atmospheric experience ". 
<|endoftext|> The few criticisms for the game centered on its length and pacing.

Peters's " history and defense " of Israel deals with the demographic history of Palestine. <unk> studies had tended to assert that the Arab population of Ottoman @-@ controlled Palestine, a 94 % majority at the turn of the century, had dwindled towards parity due to massive Zionist immigration. Peters radically challenged this picture by arguing that a substantial part of the Palestinian people were descended from immigrants from other Arab countries from the early 19th century onwards. It followed, for Peters and many of her readers, that the picture of a native Palestinian population overwhelmed by Jewish immigration was little more than propaganda, and that in actuality two almost simultaneous waves of immigration met in what had been a relatively unpopulated land. 
<|endoftext|> From Time Immemorial had been praised by figures as varied as Barbara <unk>, Theodore H. White, Elie Wiesel, and Lucy <unk>. Saul <unk>, for one, wrote in a jacket endorsement that :

<|endoftext|> In 1986, the New York Review of Books published <unk> <unk>'s review and an exchange with critics of the review in which he criticized the assumptions and evidence on which Peters's thesis relied, thus lending independent support from an expert in Palestinian demographics to Finkelstein's doctoral critique.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Early fossil remains were fragmentary, which led to much speculation on the posture and nature of Iguanodon. Iguanodon was initially portrayed as a quadrupedal horn @-@ <unk> beast. However, as more bones were discovered, Mantell observed that the forelimbs were much smaller than the hindlimbs. His rival Owen was of the opinion it was a <unk> creature with four pillar @-@ like legs. The job of overseeing the first lifesize reconstruction of dinosaurs was initially offered to Mantell, who declined due to poor health, and Owen's vision subsequently formed the basis on which the sculptures took shape. Its bipedal nature was revealed with the discovery of the Bernissart skeletons. However, it was depicted in an upright posture, with the tail dragging along the ground, acting as the third leg of a tripod. 
<|endoftext|> During his re @-@ examination of Iguanodon, David Norman was able to show that this posture was unlikely, because the long tail was stiffened with ossified tendons. To get the <unk> pose, the tail would literally have to be broken. <unk> the animal in a horizontal posture makes many aspects of the arms and pectoral <unk> more understandable. For example, the hand is relatively immobile, with the three central fingers grouped together, bearing <unk> @-@ like phalanges, and able to <unk>. This would have allowed them to bear weight. The wrist is also relatively immobile, and the arms and shoulder bones robust. These features all suggest that the animal spent time on all fours. 
<|endoftext|> Furthermore, it appears that Iguanodon became more quadrupedal as it got older and heavier ; juvenile I. bernissartensis have shorter arms than adults ( 60 % of <unk> length versus 70 % for adults ). When walking as a <unk>, the animal's hands would have been held so that the <unk> faced each other, as shown by <unk> <unk> and the anatomy of this genus's arms and hands. The three toed <unk> ( foot ) of Iguanodon was relatively long, and when walking, both the hand and the foot would have been used in a <unk> fashion ( walking on the fingers and toes ). The maximum speed of Iguanodon has been estimated at 24 km / h ( 15 mph ), which would have been as a <unk> ; it would not have been able to gallop as a <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Large three @-@ toed <unk> are known in Early Cretaceous rocks of England, particularly <unk> beds on the Isle of Wight, and these trace fossils were originally difficult to interpret. Some authors associated them with dinosaurs early on. In 1846, E. <unk> went so far as to assign them to an <unk> he named Iguanodon, and Samuel <unk> noted in 1854 that they looked like bird tracks, but might have come from dinosaurs. The identity of the <unk> was greatly clarified upon the discovery in 1857 of the hind leg of a young Iguanodon, with distinctly three @-@ toed feet, showing that

<|endoftext|> In June 1937 the Old Vic company took up an invitation to perform Hamlet in the courtyard of the castle at Elsinore, where Shakespeare located the play. Olivier secured the casting of Leigh to replace Cherry <unk> as Ophelia. Because of torrential rain the performance had to be moved from the castle courtyard to the ballroom of a local hotel, but the tradition of playing Hamlet at Elsinore was established, and Olivier was followed by, among others, Gielgud ( 1939 ), Redgrave ( 1950 ), Richard Burton ( 1954 ), Derek Jacobi ( 1979 ), Kenneth Branagh ( 1988 ) and Jude Law ( 2009 ). Back in London, the company staged Macbeth, with Olivier in the title role. The stylised production by Michel Saint @-@ Denis was not well liked, but Olivier had some good notices among the bad. On returning from Denmark, Olivier and Leigh told their respective spouses about the affair and that their marriages were over ; Esmond moved out of the marital house and in with her mother.

In less than a month Leigh had joined him, explaining that her trip was " partially because Larry's there and partially because I intend to get the part of Scarlett O <unk> " — the role in Gone with the Wind in which she was eventually cast. Olivier did not enjoy making Wuthering Heights, and his approach to film acting, combined with a dislike for Oberon, led to tensions on set. The director, William <unk>, was a hard <unk>, and Olivier learned to remove what Billington described as " the carapace of theatricality " to which he was prone, replacing it with " a <unk> reality ". The resulting film was a commercial and critical success that earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor, and created his screen reputation. Caroline Lejeune, writing for The Observer, considered that " Olivier's dark, moody face, abrupt style, and a certain fine arrogance towards the world in his playing are just right " in the role, while the reviewer for The Times wrote that Olivier " is a good embodiment of <unk>... impressive enough on a more human plane, speaking his lines with real distinction, and always both romantic and alive.

<|endoftext|> Although in his objections to Wilberforce's 1786 bill Loughborough had noted that these women were dead long before they suffered the flames, many newspapers of the day made no such distinction. The Times incorrectly stated that Sullivan was burned alive, rhetoric which, in Dr Simon <unk>'s opinion, could be " rooted in the growing <unk> for domesticated womanhood " that might have been expected at the time. As many objections may also have been raised by the perceived <unk> of drawing and burning women for coining, whereas until 1783, when the halting of executions at <unk> removed ritualistic dragging from public view, men were simply drawn and hanged.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The burning in 1789 of Christian Murphy, for coining, received practically no attention from the newspapers ( perhaps owing to practical limitations on how much news they could publish across only four pages ), but it may have been enacted by Sir Benjamin Hammett, a former sheriff of London. Hammett was also an MP, and in 1790 he introduced to Parliament a Bill for <unk> the Sentence of Burning Women. He denounced the punishment as " the savage remains of Norman policy " which " disgraced our statutes ", as " the practice did the common law ". He also highlighted how a sheriff who refused to carry out the sentence was liable to prosecution. William Wilberforce and Hammett were not the first men to attempt to end the burning of women. Almost 140 years earlier, during the <unk>, a group of lawyers and <unk> known as the Hale Commission ( after its chairman Matthew Hale ), was tasked by the House of Commons to take " into consideration what <unk> there are in the law ". Among the proposed reforms was the replacement of burning at the stake with hanging, but, mainly through the objections of various interested parties, none of the commission's proposals made it into law during the <unk> Parliament. Hammett was confident though. He believed that public opinion was on his side and that " the House would go with him in the cause of humanity ". The change in execution venues, from <unk> to Newgate, also attracted criticism. Following Phoebe Harris's burning in 1786, as well as questioning the inequality of English law The Times complained about the location of the punishment and its effect on locals : 
<|endoftext|> When remission of burning was refused, the scene of <unk> should have been changed ; the consequences have been serious ; several persons in the neighbourhood of Newgate lying ill, have been severely affected by the smoke which issued from the body of the unhappy female victim. 
<|endoftext|> Another factor was the fate of Sophia <unk>, found guilty of coining. Hammett's bill was introduced only four days before <unk>'s fate was to be decided, but a petition for her respite from burning, supported by another sheriff of London ( either Thomas Baker or William Newman ) and brought to King George III's notice by William Grenville, proved successful. <unk> suggests that her impending fate lent weight to the eventual outcome of Hammett's bill, which was to abolish the burning of women for treason through the Treason Act 1790.

This included seven different engineering battalions as well as several separate group and company sized elements. Units of the brigade were then deployed to Kuwait in early 2003, along with much of V Corps'staff. They would provide command and assistance for the 3rd Infantry Division, 82nd Airborne Division and 101st Airborne Division as they crossed the border to Iraq and attacked to the capitol region of Baghdad from the south.

When V Corps became the commanding element for the task force to rebuild Iraq, much of the invasion force, including the 130th Engineer Brigade, was sent to do jobs they had not been originally planned for, as basic utilities and sanitation conditions in Iraq were far below what was expected.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The music in Journey was composed and orchestrated by Austin Wintory, who had previously worked with Thatgamecompany on the soundtrack for Flow. Wintory worked closely on the soundtrack with sound designer Steve Johnson, as well as the programming team, so the music would dynamically tie in to both the actions of the player and sound effects caused by nearby game objects, and feel as if it were " <unk> in real time ". Johnson felt having short pieces of music that looped without reacting to the player would be a " missed opportunity ", and wanted to create music that changed while still containing a composed emotional arc. Jenova Chen met with Wintory at the start of the game's development to describe his vision for the project, and Wintory left the meeting and composed and recorded the main cello theme for the soundtrack that night. He continued to work on the soundtrack for the next three years, experimenting and discarding many ideas. The game's orchestrations were performed by the <unk> Radio Symphonic Orchestra in Macedonia. 
<|endoftext|> Unlike many games, where different songs have different themes for each character or area, Wintory chose to base all of the pieces on one theme which stood for the player and their journey, with cello solos especially representing the player. Wintory describes the music as " like a big cello concerto where you are the soloist and all the rest of the instruments represent the world around you ", though he describes it as not necessarily orchestral due to the inclusion of electronic aspects. The cello begins the game as " immersed in a sea of electronic sound ", before first emerging on its own and then merging into a full orchestra, mirroring the player's journey to the mountain. While the game's art style is based on several different cultures, Wintory tried to remove any overt cultural influences from the music to make it " as universal and culture @-@ less as possible ". Tina <unk> features as the cellist for the soundtrack. She is a close friend of Wintory and has since performed " <unk> Variations " with him, an eight @-@ minute orchestral variation on the Journey soundtrack. All of the non @-@ electronic instruments in the soundtrack were recorded with a live orchestra. 
<|endoftext|> The soundtrack was released as an album on April 10 on iTunes and the PlayStation Network. The album is a collection of the soundtrack's " most important " pieces, arranged by Wintory to stand alone without the context of the player's actions. The album comprises 18 tracks and is over 58 minutes long. It features the voice of <unk> Scott for the final track, " I Was Born for This ". After its release, the soundtrack reached the top 10 of the iTunes Soundtrack charts in more than 20 countries. It also reached No. 116 on the Billboard sales charts, with over 4000 units sold in its first week after release, the second @-@ highest position of any video game music album to date. The soundtrack was released as a physical album by <unk> Else Music Works on October 9, 2012. In 2012 Wintory released a download @-@ only album of music on Bandcamp titled Journey <unk> <unk>, which includes variations on themes from Journey and Flow. The soundtrack itself was subsequently released on Bandcamp on June 19, 2013. An album of piano arrangements titled <unk> was released on May 1, 2014, on Bandcamp as both a digital and physical album. A two @-@ record vinyl version of the album was released in 2015. 
<|endoftext|> In January 2016, Wintory started a Kickstarter for a Journey Live concert tour, in which the fifteen @-@ piece Fifth House Ensemble from Chicago will perform the music from the game while a player works their way through the game. The ensemble will react to the player's actions, using a specially @-@ scored version of the soundtrack, composed by Patrick O 'Malley with Wintory's oversight, that breaks the music into small pieces to enable this reaction. Wintory had wanted to do a performance of the Journey soundtrack in this interactive manner, but did not have the time to rework the soundtrack for this purpose. Wintory came to know Dan <unk>, the composer for Fifth House Ensemble, after <unk> published his praise for the Journey soundtrack and had encouraged other members of the ensemble to play the game. The group saw how Journey's soundtrack had been used for various Video Games Live concerts and believed they could pull off Wintory's vision of an interactive concert, doing most of the reworking of the soundtrack under Wintory's direction.

As the NDH imposed its authority, members of the fascist Ustaše ruling party began a campaign of persecution against Serbs throughout the country. In eastern Herzegovina, the Ustaše <unk> a series of massacres and attacks against the majority Serb population commencing in the first week of June. Between 3 and 22 June 1941, spontaneous clashes occurred between NDH authorities and groups of Serbs in the region. 
<|endoftext|> The German invasion of the Soviet Union began on 22 June. Over the next two days, the sporadic <unk> by Serbs against the NDH in eastern Herzegovina erupted into mass rebellion, triggered by Ustaše persecution, Serb solidarity with the Russian people, hatred and fear of the NDH authorities, and other factors. Serb rebels, under the leadership of both local Serbs and Montenegrins, attacked police, gendarmerie, Ustaše and Croatian Home Guard forces in the region. In the first few days, the rebels captured gendarmerie posts in several villages, set up roadblocks on the major roads and ambushed several military vehicles. On the night of 26 June, the rebels mounted a sustained attack on the town of Nevesinje in an attempt to capture it, but the garrison held out until the morning of 28 June when NDH troops broke through the rebel roadblocks. 
<|endoftext|> On 28 June, the rebels ambushed a <unk> of Italian soldiers, prompting the Italian Army commander in the NDH to warn the NDH government that he would take unilateral action to secure communication routes. A further gendarmerie post was destroyed by the rebels, and in the evening the rebels captured the village of Avtovac, looting and burning it, and killing dozens of non @-@ Serb civilians. The following day an Italian column cleared the rebels from Avtovac and relieved the hard @-@ pressed NDH garrison in the town of Gacko. From 3 July, an NDH force of over 2 @,@ 000 fanned out from Nevesinje, clearing towns, villages and routes of rebels. The rebel forces did not put up any significant opposition to the clearing operation, and either retreated into nearby Montenegro, or hid their weapons in the mountains and went home. By 7 July, NDH forces had regained full control of all towns and major transport routes in eastern Herzegovina.

It was essentially an Italo – German quasi @-@ protectorate, as it owed its existence to the Axis powers, who maintained occupation forces within the puppet state throughout its existence. In the immediate aftermath of the Yugoslav surrender on 17 April, former Royal Yugoslav Army troops returned to their homes in eastern Herzegovina with their weapons.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = <unk> = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Over twenty skulls have been found from this dinosaur. As with other lambeosaurines, the animal bore a tall, elaborate bony crest atop its skull, which contained the <unk> narial passages. The narial passages extended into the crest, first into separate pockets in the sides, then into a single central chamber and onward into the respiratory system. The skull of the type specimen has no dermal impressions on it. During preservation it was compressed laterally, so now the width is about two @-@ thirds what it would have been in real life. According to Brown, the compression also caused the nasals to shift where they pressed down on the premaxillaries. Because they were pressed on the premaxillaries, the nasals would have closed the nares. Apart from the compression, the skull appears to be normal. Contrary to what Brown assumed, the areas concerned were fully part of the praemaxillae. 
<|endoftext|> The crests of Corythosaurus resemble that of a cassowary, or a Corinthian helmet. They are formed by a combination of the praemaxillae, nasals, prefrontals and frontals, as in Saurolophus, but instead of projecting backwards as a spine, they rise up to make the highest point above the orbit. The two halves of the crest are separated by a median <unk>. In front of the orbit, the crest is made of thick bone. 
<|endoftext|> The nasals make up most of the crest. Brown assumed that they extended from the beaks'tip to the highest spot along the crest and that, unlike those in other genera, the nasals meet in the centre and are not separated in front by an ascending premaxillary process. Brown however, mistook the praemaxillae for the nasals ; the snout is actually largely formed by them and they do separate the nasals. Brown also thought that on the top and back of the crest, the whole external face is covered by the frontals. Again he made a mistake : what he assumed to be the frontals are in fact the nasals. The nasals end at the back of the <unk> in a hooked, short process. The prefrontals also make up part of the crest ; however, Brown mistook the lower upper branch of the <unk> for the prefrontal. The actual prefrontal, triangular in shape, is located at the side of the crest base ; it was by Brown seen as a part of the frontal. The real frontals, largely internal to the crest base structure, are not visible from the side. 
<|endoftext|> The mouth of the holotype of Corythosaurus is narrow. The praemaxillae each form two long folds. The folds <unk> air passages extending the narial passages to the front of the snout. There they end in narrow openings, sometimes called " pseudonares ", false bony nostrils. These were mistaken by Brown for the real nares or nostrils. These are actually situated inside the crest, above the eye <unk>. As in Saurolophus, the expanded portion of the premaxillary in front of the <unk>'opening is <unk> : by comparison, in Kritosaurus, the bill is short, and the pseudonares extend far forward. At the end of the Corythosaurus bill, the two pseudonares unite into one. Because of his incorrect identification, Brown assumed that the holotype's inferior process of the premaxillary was shorter than in Kritosaurus and Saurolophus, and that the process does not unite with the

A northern extension to Bay City replaced a section of M @-@ 111 in 1929, and extended farther to Bay City State Park in 1933. M @-@ 47 replaced the remainder of M @-@ 111 and extended southward from the park to Bay City in 1938, creating a " U @-@ turn " in the routing. The southern terminus was moved again in late 1951 or early 1952 to Webberville, although still ending on US 16.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The entry and exit of large molecules from the nucleus is tightly controlled by the nuclear pore complexes. Although small molecules can enter the nucleus without regulation, macromolecules such as RNA and proteins require association karyopherins called importins to enter the nucleus and exportins to exit. " <unk> " proteins that must be <unk> from the cytoplasm to the nucleus contain short amino acid sequences known as nuclear localization signals, which are bound by importins, while those transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm carry nuclear export signals bound by exportins. The ability of importins and exportins to transport their cargo is regulated by <unk>, enzymes that <unk> the molecule <unk> <unk> to release energy. The key <unk> in nuclear transport is <unk>, which can bind either <unk> or GDP ( <unk> <unk> ), depending on whether it is located in the nucleus or the cytoplasm. Whereas importins depend on RanGTP to <unk> from their cargo, exportins require RanGTP in order to bind to their cargo. 
<|endoftext|> Nuclear import depends on the importin binding its cargo in the cytoplasm and carrying it through the nuclear pore into the nucleus. Inside the nucleus, RanGTP acts to separate the cargo from the importin, allowing the importin to exit the nucleus and be reused. Nuclear export is similar, as the <unk> binds the cargo inside the nucleus in a process facilitated by RanGTP, exits through the nuclear pore, and separates from its cargo in the cytoplasm. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> export proteins exist for translocation of mature mRNA and tRNA to the cytoplasm after post @-@ transcriptional modification is complete. This quality @-@ control mechanism is important due to these molecules'central role in protein translation. <unk> @-@ expression of a protein due to incomplete excision of exons or mis @-@ incorporation of amino acids could have negative consequences for the cell ; thus, incompletely modified RNA that reaches the cytoplasm is degraded rather than used in translation.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> During its lifetime, a nucleus may be broken down or destroyed, either in the process of cell division or as a consequence of apoptosis ( the process of programmed cell death ). During these events, the structural components of the nucleus — the envelope and lamina — can be systematically degraded. In most cells, the disassembly of the nuclear envelope marks the end of the <unk> of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some <unk> eukaryotes ( e.g., <unk> ) undergo so @-@ called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear envelope remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown of the nuclear envelope. The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the <unk> spindle, and new nuclei <unk> around them. 
<|endoftext|> At a certain point during the cell cycle in open mitosis, the cell divides to form two cells. In order for this process to be possible, each of the new daughter cells must have a full set of genes, a process requiring replication of the chromosomes as well as segregation of the separate sets. This occurs by the replicated chromosomes, the sister chromatids, <unk> to microtubules, which in turn are attached to different centrosomes. The sister chromatids can then be pulled to separate locations in the cell.

Therefore, the early stages in the cell cycle, beginning in <unk> and until around <unk>, the nuclear membrane is dismantled.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> <unk> that have vertices representing events, and edges representing causal relations between events, are often acyclic – arranging the vertices in linear order of time, all arrows point in the same direction as time, from parent to child ( due to <unk> affecting the future, not the past ), and thus have no loops. 
<|endoftext|> For instance, a Bayesian network represents a system of <unk> events as vertices in a directed acyclic graph, in which the likelihood of an event may be calculated from the <unk> of its predecessors in the DAG. In this context, the moral graph of a DAG is the undirected graph created by adding an ( undirected ) edge between all parents of the same vertex ( sometimes called marrying ), and then replacing all directed edges by undirected edges. 
<|endoftext|> Another type of graph with a similar causal structure is an influence diagram, the vertices of which represent either decisions to be made or unknown information, and the edges of which represent causal influences from one vertex to another. In <unk>, for instance, these <unk> are often used to estimate the expected value of different choices for intervention.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Family trees may be seen as directed acyclic graphs, with a vertex for each family member and an edge for each parent @-@ child relationship. Despite the name, these graphs are not necessarily trees because of the possibility of marriages between relatives ( so a child has a common ancestor on both the mother's and father's side ) causing pedigree collapse. The graphs of <unk> descent ( " mother " relationships between women ) and <unk> descent ( " father " relationships between men ) are trees within this graph. Because no one can become their own ancestor, family trees are acyclic. 
<|endoftext|> For the same reason, the version history of a distributed revision control system generally has the structure of a directed acyclic graph, in which there is a vertex for each revision and an edge connecting pairs of revisions that were directly derived from each other. These are not trees in general due to <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> In many randomized algorithms in computational geometry, the algorithm maintains a history DAG representing the version history of a <unk> structure over the course of a sequence of changes to the structure. For instance in a randomized incremental algorithm for Delaunay triangulation, the triangulation changes by replacing one triangle by three smaller triangles when each point is added, and by " flip " operations that replace pairs of triangles by a different pair of triangles. The history DAG for this algorithm has a vertex for each triangle constructed as part of the algorithm, and edges from each triangle to the two or three other triangles that replace it. This structure allows point location queries to be answered efficiently : to find the location of a query point q in the Delaunay triangulation, follow a path in the history DAG, at each step moving to the replacement triangle that contains q. The final triangle reached in this path must be the Delaunay triangle that contains q.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Directed acyclic graphs may also be used as a compact representation of a collection of sequences. In this type of application, one finds a DAG in which the paths form the given sequences. When many of the sequences share the same <unk>, these shared <unk> can be represented by a shared part of the DAG, allowing the representation to use less space than it would take to list out all of the sequences separately. For example, the directed acyclic word graph is a data structure in computer science formed by a directed acyclic graph with a single source and with edges labeled by letters or symbols ; the paths from the source to the sinks in this graph represent a set of strings, such as English words. Any set of sequences can be represented as paths in a tree, by forming a tree vertex for every prefix of a sequence and making the parent of one of these vertices represent the sequence with one fewer element ; the tree formed in this way for a set of strings is called a <unk>. A directed acyclic word graph saves space over a <unk> by allowing paths to <unk> and rejoin, so that a set of words with the same possible <unk> can be represented by a single tree vertex. 
<|endoftext|> The same idea of using a DAG to represent a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram, a DAG @-@ based data structure for representing binary functions.

<|endoftext|> In 1958 Goffman became a faculty member in the sociology department at the University of California, Berkeley, first as a visiting professor, then from 1962 as a full professor. In 1968 he moved to the University of Pennsylvania, receiving the Benjamin Franklin <unk> in Sociology and Anthropology, due largely to the efforts of Dell <unk>, a former colleague at Berkeley. In 1969 he became a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1970 Goffman became a <unk> of the American Association for the Abolition of <unk> Mental <unk> and <unk> its Platform Statement. In 1971 he published Relations in Public, in which he tied together many of his ideas about everyday life, seen from a sociological perspective. Another major book of his, Frame Analysis, came out in 1974. He received a <unk> Fellowship for 1977 – 78. In 1979, Goffman received the <unk> @-@ Mead Award for Distinguished Scholarship, from the Section on Social Psychology of the American Sociological Association.

His work has, however, influenced and been discussed by numerous contemporary sociologists, including Anthony Giddens, Jürgen Habermas and Pierre <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Though Goffman is often associated with the symbolic interaction school of sociological thought, he did not see himself as a representative of it, and so Fine and Manning conclude that he " does not easily fit within a specific school of sociological thought ". His ideas are also " difficult to reduce to a number of key themes " ; his work can be broadly described as developing " a comparative, <unk> sociology that aimed to produce <unk> about human behavior ". 
<|endoftext|> Goffman made substantial advances in the study of face @-@ to @-@ face interaction, elaborated the " dramaturgical approach " to human interaction, and developed numerous concepts that have had a massive influence, particularly in the field of the micro @-@ sociology of everyday life. Many of his works have concerned the organization of everyday behavior, a concept he termed " interaction order ". He contributed to the sociological concept of framing ( frame analysis ), to game theory ( the concept of strategic interaction ), and to the study of interactions and <unk>. With regard to the latter, he argued that the activity of speaking must be seen as a social rather than a linguistic construct. From a methodological perspective, Goffman often employed <unk> approaches, specifically ethnography, most famously in his study of social aspects of mental illness, in particular the functioning of total institutions. Overall, his contributions are valued as an attempt to create a theory that bridges the agency @-@ and @-@ structure divide – for popularizing social <unk>, symbolic interaction, conversation analysis, ethnographic studies, and the study and importance of individual interactions.

<|endoftext|> The field of the stadium combines a number of elements for use in the jumping and throwing events. The long jump and triple jump areas comprise a straight, narrow 40 @-@ metre running track with a sandpit at one or both ends. <unk> are measured from a take off board — typically a small strip of wood with a <unk> marker attached — which ensures athletes jump from behind the measurement line. The pole vault area is also a 40 @-@ metre running track and has an <unk> in the ground ( the box ) where <unk> plant their poles to propel themselves over a crossbar before falling onto <unk> landing mats. The high jump is a stripped down version of this, with an open area of track or field that leads to a crossbar with a square area of landing mats behind it. 
<|endoftext|> The four throwing events generally all begin on one side of the stadium. The javelin throw typically takes place on a piece of track that is central and parallel to the <unk> of the main running track. The javelin throwing area is a sector shape frequently across the <unk> ( sports field ) in the middle of the stadium, ensuring that the javelin has a minimal chance of causing damage or injury. The discus throw and hammer throw contests begin in a tall metal cage usually situated in one of the corners of the field. The cage reduces the danger of implements being thrown out of the field of play and throws travel <unk> across the field in the centre of the stadium. The shot put features a circular throwing area with a toe board at one end. The throwing area is a sector. Some stadia also have a water jump area on one side of the field specifically for steeplechase races.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Basic indoor venues may be adapted <unk>, which can easily accommodate high jump competitions and short track events. Full @-@ size indoor arenas ( i.e. those fully equipped to host all events for the World Indoor Championships ) bear similarities with their outdoor equivalents. Typically, a central area is surrounded by a 200 @-@ metre oval track with four to eight lanes. The track can be banked at the turns to allow athletes to run around the radius more comfortably. There is also a second running track going straight across the field area, parallel to the <unk> of the main circuit. This track is used for the 60 metres and 60 metres hurdles events, which are held almost exclusively indoors. 
<|endoftext|> Another common adaptation is a 160 @-@ yard track ( 11 laps to a mile ) that fits into a common basketball court sized arena. This was quite popular when races were held at imperial distances, which gradually was phased out by different organizations in the 1970s and 1980s. Examples of this configuration include the <unk> Games at Madison Square Garden, and the <unk> <unk> formerly held in the Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
<|endoftext|> All four of the common jumping events are held at indoor venues. The long and triple jump areas run alongside the central 60 m track and are mostly identical in form to their outdoor counterparts. The pole vault track and landing area are also alongside the central running track. Shot put ( or weight throw ) is the only throwing event held indoors due to size restrictions. The throwing area is similar to the outdoor event, but the landing sector is a rectangular section surrounded by netting or a stop barrier.

The following day Raymond marched on the castle and found it deserted. The crusaders briefly occupied the castle in February of the same year but abandoned it when they continued their march towards Jerusalem. Permanent occupation began in <unk> when <unk>, Prince of Galilee took control of the site. The early castle was substantially different from the extant remains and no trace of this first castle survives at the site. 
<|endoftext|> The origins of the Knights Hospitaller are unclear, but the order probably emerged around the <unk> in Jerusalem. It started as a religious order which cared for the sick, and later looked after pilgrims to the Holy Land. After the success of the First Crusade in capturing Jerusalem in 1099, many crusaders donated their new property in the Levant to the Hospital of St John. Early donations were in the newly formed Kingdom of Jerusalem, but over time the order extended its holdings to the Crusader states of the County of Tripoli and the Principality of Antioch. Evidence suggests that in the <unk> the order became <unk> when Fulk, King of Jerusalem, granted the newly built castle at <unk> to the order in 1136. A papal bull from between 1139 and <unk> may indicate the order hiring people to defend pilgrims. There were also other military orders, such as the Knights Templar, which offered protection to pilgrims. 
<|endoftext|> Between 1142 and <unk> Raymond II, Count of Tripoli, granted the order property in the county. According to historian Jonathan Riley @-@ Smith, the Hospitallers effectively established a " palatinate " within Tripoli. The property included castles with which the Hospitallers were expected to defend Tripoli. Along with Krak des Chevaliers, the Hospitallers were given four other castles along the borders of the state which allowed the order to dominate the area. The order's agreement with Raymond II stated that if he did not accompany knights of the order on campaign, the spoils belonged entirely to the order, and if he was present it was split equally between the count and the order. Raymond II could further not make peace with the Muslims without the permission of the Hospitallers. The Hospitallers made Krak des Chevaliers a center of administration for their new property, undertaking work at the castle that would make it one of the most elaborate Crusader fortifications in the Levant. 
<|endoftext|> After acquiring the site in 1142, they began building a new castle to replace the former Kurdish fortification. This work lasted until 1170, when an earthquake damaged the castle. An Arab source mentions that the quake destroyed the castle's chapel, which was replaced by the present chapel. In <unk> the Crusaders emerged victorious over Nur ad @-@ Din in the Battle of al @-@ <unk> near Krak des Chevaliers. 
<|endoftext|> Drought conditions between 1175 and 1180 prompted the Crusaders to sign a two @-@ year truce with the Muslims, but without Tripoli included in the terms. During the <unk> raids by Christians and Muslims into each other's territory became more frequent. In 1180, Saladin ventured into the County of Tripoli, <unk> the area. Unwilling to meet him in open battle, the Crusaders retreated to the relative safety of their fortifications. Without capturing the castles, Saladin could not secure control of the area, and once he retreated the Hospitallers were able to <unk> their damaged lands. The Battle of <unk> in 1187 was a disastrous defeat for the Crusaders : Guy of <unk>, King of Jerusalem, was captured, as was the True Cross, a relic discovered during the First Crusade. Afterwards Saladin ordered the execution of the captured Templar and Hospitaller knights, such was the importance of the two orders in defending the Crusader states. After the battle, the Hospitaller castles of <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> fell to Muslim armies. Following these losses, the Order focused its attention on its castles in Tripoli. In May <unk> Saladin led an army to attack Krak des Chevaliers, but on seeing the castle decided it was too well defended and instead marched on the Hospitaller castle of Margat, which he also failed to capture. 
<|endoftext|> Another earthquake struck in <unk>, and it may have been after this event that the castle was remodelled. The 13th @-@ century work was the last period of building at Krak des Chevaliers and gave it its current appearance. An enclosing stone circuit was built between 1142 and

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = Territorial era of Minnesota = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The territorial era of Minnesota covers the history of the land that is now the modern US state of Minnesota from the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, to its achieving statehood in 1858. The Minnesota Territory itself was formed only in 1849 but the area had a rich history well before this. Though there was a long history of European presence in the area before 19th century, it was during the 19th century that the United States began to establish a firm presence in what would become Minnesota. 
<|endoftext|> Many of the <unk> of Minnesota culture that are perceived as the area's early history in fact originated after this period. Notably, the heavy Scandinavian immigration for which the state is known, and the pioneering days chronicled by author Laura <unk> Wilder occurred after statehood in the later 19th century. Unlike these later years, the first half of the 19th century was characterized by sparsely populated communities, harsh living conditions, and to some degree, lawlessness. 
<|endoftext|> This era was a period of economic transition. The dominant enterprise in the area since the 17th century had been the fur trade. The Dakota Sioux, and later the Ojibwe, tribes hunted and gathered pelts trading with French, British, and later American traders at Grand Portage, Mendota, and other sites. This trade gradually declined during the early 19th century as demand for furs in Europe diminished. The lumber industry grew rapidly, replacing furs as the key economic resource. Grain production began to develop late during this time as an emerging economic basis as well. Saw mills, and later grain mills, around Fort Snelling and Saint Anthony Falls in east @-@ central Minnesota became magnets for development. By the end of the era east @-@ central Minnesota had replaced northern Minnesota as the economic center of the area. 
<|endoftext|> This era was also as a period of cultural transition. At the time the U.S. took possession of the region, Native Americans were by far the largest ethnic groups. Their role in the fur trade gave them a steady stream of income and significant political influence even as the French, British, and Americans asserted territorial claims on the area. French and British traders had mixed with native society in the area for many decades peacefully contributing to the society and creating new ethnic groups consisting of mixed @-@ race peoples. As the Americans established outposts in the area and the fur trade declined, the dynamics changed dramatically. The economic influence of the Native Americans diminished and American territorial ideology increasingly sought to limit their influence. Large waves of immigration in the 1850s very suddenly changed the demographics so that within a few years the population shifted from predominantly native to predominantly people of European descent. The native and mixed @-@ race populations continued to influence the territory's culture and politics, even at the end of the territorial era, though by the time statehood was achieved that influence was in steep decline. Heavy immigration from New England and New York led to Minnesota's being labeled the " New England of the West ".

Later that year, the new director, Edward O. <unk>, issued a report stating that the gold dollar " is too small for circulation, and... [ is ] used almost exclusively for the purposes of ornament.

Achille, already damaged, was totally dismasted in the exchange and briefly surrendered, although her crew rescinded this when it became clear Brunswick was in no position to take possession. With her colours <unk>, Achille then made what sail she could in an attempt to join Villaret to the north. It was not until 12 : 45 that the shattered Vengeur and Brunswick pulled apart, both largely dismasted and very battered.

The cat has many local or regional names in the United States and Canada, of which cougar, puma, mountain lion, and panther are popular. " Mountain lion " was a term first used in writing in 1858 from the diary of George A. Jackson of Colorado. Other names include <unk> ( probably a contraction from " cat of the mountain " ), mountain <unk>, and painter. <unk> regard painter as a primarily upper @-@ Southern US regional variant on panther.

<|endoftext|> P. concolor holds the Guinness record for the animal with the greatest number of names, with over 40 in English alone. 
<|endoftext|> " Cougar " may be borrowed from the archaic Portuguese <unk> ; the term was originally derived from the <unk> language <unk> <unk>, meaning " similar to deer ( in hair color ) ".

People in rural regions often refer to both the cougar and the jaguar as simply <unk> ( she @-@ cat ), and outside of the Amazon, both are colloquially referred to as simply onça by many people ( that is also a name for the leopard in Angola ). 
<|endoftext|> In the 17th century, German naturalist Georg <unk> named the cat the <unk> ara. <unk>'s rendering was reproduced by his associate, Dutch naturalist Willem <unk>, in 1648. <unk> ara was then adopted by English naturalist John Ray in 1693.

<|endoftext|> Neolithic was a revolutionary period of British history. Beginning in the fifth millennium BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. Archaeologists have been unable to prove whether this adoption of farming was because of a new influx of migrants coming in from continental Europe or because the indigenous Mesolithic Britons came to adopt the agricultural practices of continental societies. Either way, it certainly emerged through contact with continental Europe, probably as a result of centuries of interaction between Mesolithic people living in south @-@ east Britain and Linear <unk> culture ( <unk> ) communities in north @-@ eastern France. The region of modern Kent would have been a key area for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent. 
<|endoftext|> Between <unk> and <unk> BCE, all of the British Isles came to abandon its former Mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherer lifestyle, to be replaced by the new agricultural subsistence of the Neolithic Age. Although a common material culture was shared throughout most of the British Isles in this period, there was great regional variation regarding the nature and distribution of settlement, architectural styles, and the use of natural resources. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the Early Neolithic economy on the island was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi @-@ nomadic way of life. Although witnessing some land clearance, Britain was largely forested in this period, and it is unclear what level of <unk> the area of Kent had experienced in the Early Neolithic ; widespread forest clearance only took place on the <unk> of south @-@ east Britain in the Late Bronze Age. Environmental data from the area around the White Horse Stone supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, <unk> / alder and <unk>. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = The tomb building tradition = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Across Western Europe, the Early Neolithic marked the first period in which humans built monumental structures in the landscape. These were tombs that held the physical remains of the dead, and though sometimes constructed out of timber, many were built using large stones, now known as " megaliths ". Individuals were rarely buried alone in the Early Neolithic, instead being interned in collective burials with other members of their community. The construction of these collective burial monumental tombs, both wooden and megalithic, began in continental Europe before being adopted in Britain in the first half of the fourth millennium BCE. 
<|endoftext|> The Early Neolithic people of Britain placed far greater emphasis on the ritualised burial of the dead than their Mesolithic forebears had done. Many archaeologists have suggested that this is because Early Neolithic people adhered to an ancestor cult that venerated the spirits of the dead, believing that they could intercede with the forces of nature for the benefit of their living descendants. Archaeologist Robin <unk> stressed that rather than simply being tombs, the Medway Megaliths were " communal <unk> fulfilling a social function for the communities who built and used them. " Thus, it has furthermore been suggested that Early Neolithic people entered into the tombs – which doubled as temples or shrines – to perform rituals that would honour the dead and ask for their assistance. For this reason, historian Ronald Hutton termed these monuments " tomb @-@ shrines " to reflect their dual purpose. 
<|endoftext|> In Britain, these tombs were typically located on prominent hills and slopes overlooking the surrounding landscape, perhaps at the junction between different territories. Archaeologist Caroline Malone noted that the tombs would have served as one of a variety of markers in the landscape that conveyed information on " territory, political allegiance, ownership, and ancestors. " Many archaeologists have subscribed to the idea that these tomb @-@ shrines served as territorial markers between different tribal groups, although others have argued that such markers would be of little use to a nomadic herding society. Instead it has been suggested that they represent markers along herding pathways. Many archaeologists have suggested that the construction of such monuments reflects an attempt to stamp control and ownership over the land, thus representing a change in mindset brought about by <unk>. Others have suggested that these monuments were built on sites already deemed sacred by Mesolithic hunter @-@ gatherers.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> On September 26, 1964, Nguyễn Khánh and the senior officers in his military junta created a semblance of civilian rule by forming the High National Council ( HNC ), an appointed advisory body akin to a legislature. This came after lobbying by American officials — led by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor — in Vietnam, as they placed great value in the appearance of civilian legitimacy, which they saw as vital to building a popular base for any government. Khánh put his rival General Dương Văn Minh — who he had deposed in a January 1964 coup — in charge of picking the 17 members of the HNC, and Minh filled it with figures sympathetic to him.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The Rocky Mountain Horse is a horse breed developed in the state of Kentucky in the United States. Despite its name, it originated not in the Rocky Mountains, but instead in the Appalachian Mountains. A foundation stallion, brought from the western United States to eastern Kentucky around 1890, began the Rocky Mountain type in the late 19th century. In the mid @-@ 20th century, a stallion named Old Tobe, owned by a prominent breeder, was used to develop the modern type ; today most Rocky Mountain Horses trace back to this stallion. In 1986, the Rocky Mountain Horse Association was formed and by 2005 has registered over 12 @,@ 000 horses. The breed is known for its preferred " chocolate " coat color and flaxen mane and tail, the result of the relatively rare silver dapple gene acting on a black coat, seen in much of the population. It also exhibits a four @-@ beat ambling gait known as the " single @-@ foot ". Originally developed as a multi @-@ purpose riding, driving and light draft horse, today it is used mainly for trail riding and working cattle.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Rocky Mountain Horses stand between 14 @.@ 2 and 16 hands ( 58 and 64 inches, 147 and 163 cm ) high. Any solid color is accepted by the registry, but a dark brown color called " chocolate " with a pale, " flaxen " mane and tail is preferred. This coloration is the result of the relatively rare silver dapple gene acting on a black base coat. Although uncommon, this gene has been found in over a dozen breeds, including the Rocky Mountain Horse. <unk> white markings are accepted by the registry, although leg markings may not extend above the knee. The physical characteristics are somewhat variable, due to the disparate breeds that created the Rocky Mountain Horse. The Rocky Mountain Horse is known by enthusiasts for its <unk> and ability to withstand winters in the mountains. It is also praised for its good nature and affinity for humans. Rocky Mountain Horses have the highest risk of any breed for the genetic ocular syndrome multiple congenital ocular <unk> ( MCOA ), originally called <unk> anterior segment <unk> ( <unk> ). MCOA is characterized by the abnormal development of some ocular tissues, which causes compromised vision, although generally of a mild form ; the disease is non @-@ progressive. Genetic studies have shown that the disorder may be tied to the silver dapple gene, as most horses diagnosed with MCOA carry the gene. 
<|endoftext|> The breed exhibits a natural ambling gait, called the single @-@ foot, which replaces the trot seen in a majority of horse breeds. Both gaits are an intermediate speed between a walk and a <unk> or gallop ; ambling gaits are four @-@ beat gaits, whereas the trot is a two @-@ beat gait. The extra <unk> provide additional <unk> to a rider because the horse always has at least one foot on the ground.

Thus, a Rocky Mountain Horse, with rider, can use the single @-@ foot to cover rough ground at around 7 miles per hour ( 11 km / h ) and short stretches of smooth ground at up to 16 miles per hour ( 26 km / h ).

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Roger Federer ( German : [ <unk> ] born 8 August 1981 ) is a Swiss professional tennis player who is currently ranked world No. 3 by the Association of Tennis <unk> ( ATP ). His accomplishments in professional tennis have led to him being regarded by many as the greatest tennis player of all time. Federer turned professional in 1998 and has been continuously ranked in the top 10 since October 2002. 
<|endoftext|> Federer holds several records of the Open Era : holding the world No. 1 position for 302 weeks ( including 237 consecutive weeks ) ; winning 17 Grand Slam singles titles ; reaching each Grand Slam final at least five times ( an all @-@ time record ) ; and reaching the Wimbledon final ten times. He is among the eight men ( and among the five in Open Era ) to capture a career Grand Slam. Federer shares an Open Era record for most titles at Wimbledon with Pete Sampras ( seven ) and at the US Open with Jimmy Connors and Sampras ( five ). He is the only male player to win five consecutive US Open titles. 
<|endoftext|> Federer has reached 27 men's singles Grand Slam finals, including 10 in a row from the 2005 Wimbledon Championships to the 2007 US Open, both statistics being records. He also appeared in 18 of 19 finals from the 2005 Wimbledon through to the 2010 Australian Open. He reached the semifinals at 23 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments, from the 2004 Wimbledon Championships through the 2010 Australian Open. At the 2016 Wimbledon Championships, he reached a record 48th Grand Slam quarterfinal and a record 40th Grand Slam semifinal. Earlier at the 2016 Australian Open, he played in a record 65th consecutive Grand Slam tournament. Earlier at the 2015 US Open, he reached a record 27th Grand Slam final. Also earlier at the 2013 French Open, Federer reached a record 36th consecutive Grand Slam quarterfinal. Federer has won the most matches in Grand Slam events ( <unk> ) and is the first to record 65 + wins at each Grand Slam tournament. 
<|endoftext|> Federer's ATP tournament records include winning a record six ATP World Tour Finals, playing in the finals at all nine ATP Masters 1000 tournaments ( a record shared with Djokovic and Nadal ). He also won the Olympic gold medal in doubles with his compatriot Stan Wawrinka at the 2008 Summer Olympic Games and the Olympic silver medal in singles at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. Representing Switzerland, he was a part of the 2014 winning Davis Cup team. He finished eight consecutive years ( 2003 – 2010 ) in one of the top two positions in the year @-@ end men's rankings and ten ( 2003 – 2012 ) in the top three.

<|endoftext|> By 1972 there was growing pressure from other commanders, particularly Kaúlza de Arriaga's second in command, General Francisco da Costa <unk>, for the use of African soldiers in Flechas units. Flechas units ( Arrows ) were also employed in Angola and were units under the command of the Portuguese PIDE. <unk> of local tribesmen, the units specialised in tracking, reconnaissance and anti @-@ terrorist operations. 
<|endoftext|> Costa <unk> argued that African soldiers were cheaper and were better able to create a relationship with the local populace, a tactic similar to the'hearts and minds'strategy being used by United States forces in Vietnam at the time. These Flechas units saw action in the territory at the very end stages of the conflict, following the dismissal of Kaúlza de Arriaga on the eve of the Portuguese coup in 1974 – the Carnation Revolution. The units were to continue to cause problems for the FRELIMO even after the Revolution and Portuguese withdrawal, when the country splintered into civil war. 
<|endoftext|> There were several Portuguese special forces units that were unique to either the Mozambican conflict or the Portuguese Colonial War as a whole :

<|endoftext|> During the entire period of 1970 – 74, FRELIMO intensified guerrilla operations, specialising in urban terrorism. The use of landmines also intensified, with sources stating that they had become responsible for two out of every three Portuguese casualties. During the conflict, FRELIMO used a variety of anti @-@ tank and anti @-@ personnel mines, including the <unk> ( Black Widow ), <unk> @-@ 46, and <unk>. Even amphibious mines were used, such as the <unk>. Mine <unk>, an acute fear of landmines, was rampant in the Portuguese forces.

The Gordian <unk> Operation ( Portuguese : <unk> <unk> <unk> ) targeted permanent insurgent camps and the infiltration routes across the <unk> border in the north of Mozambique over a period of seven months. The operation involved some 35 @,@ 000 Portuguese troops, particularly elite units like paratroopers, commandos, marines and naval <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> The Portuguese had excellent coordination between light bombers, helicopters and reinforced ground patrols. They utilised American tactics of quick airborne ( <unk> ) assaults supported by heavy aerial bombardments of FRELIMO camps by the Portuguese Air Force ( <unk> <unk> <unk> or FAP ) to surround and eliminate the guerrillas. These bombardments were accompanied by the use of heavy artillery. The Portuguese also used cavalry units to cover the flanks of patrols and where the terrain was too difficult to motor transport, and units of captured or deserted guerrillas to penetrate their former bases. 
<|endoftext|> Problems for the Portuguese arose almost immediately when the offensive coincided with the beginning of the monsoon season, creating additional logistical difficulties. Not only were the Portuguese soldiers badly equipped, but there was very poor cooperation, if any at all, between the FAP and the army. Thus, the army lacked close air support from the FAP. <unk> Portuguese casualties began to <unk> FRELIMO casualties, leading to further political intervention from Lisbon. 
<|endoftext|> The Portuguese eventually reported <unk> as killed ( a figure of some 440 was most likely closer to reality ), and 1 @,@ 840 captured, for the loss of 132 Portuguese. Gen.

<|endoftext|> key, officially referred to as the free throw lane by the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) and the National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ), the restricted area by the international governing body FIBA, and colloquially as the lane or the paint, is an area on a basketball court underneath the basket bounded by the <unk>, the foul line and other lines which are known as <unk> lines, that are usually painted ( although <unk> on some courts with painted <unk> ). It is a critical area on the court where much of the action takes place in a game. 
<|endoftext|> The key, in all games, starting with FIBA's amendments to its rules in 2010 ( to be first implemented after the 2010 FIBA World Championship ), is rectangular. Prior to 2006, the key in FIBA @-@ sanctioned tournaments ( mostly basketball played outside the United States, and almost all international tournaments including the World Championships and the Olympics ) was trapezoidal in shape. Both NBA and FIBA keys are 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) wide, while NCAA keys are narrower at 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ). 
<|endoftext|> The most @-@ commonly enforced rule on the key is the " three seconds rule " in which a player from the offensive team is prohibited from staying on the key for more than three seconds, or else the player's team will lose possession of the ball. Another rule enforced is the lane violation in which players from both teams are prohibited to enter the lane until after the free throw shooter releases the ball from his hands ( the shooter is prohibited to enter the key until after the ball hits the rim ).

In addition to the <unk> <unk>, the key includes a free @-@ throw circle at its " head " or " top ". 
<|endoftext|> The width of the key in the NBA is 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ), including the 2 @-@ foot ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) wide foul lanes ; in U.S. college ( NCAA ) and high @-@ school play, it is 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ).

From 1956 until 2010, FIBA @-@ sanctioned tournaments used a trapezoidal key. The narrower end was on the free @-@ throw line, where it was 3 @.@ 6 meters ( 12 ft ), while the wider end, at the end line, measured 6 meters ( 20 ft ). 
<|endoftext|> The free throw circle has a six @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) radius and is centered at the midpoint of the free throw line ; the half of those circle on the mid @-@ court side of the free throw line is painted in solid lines. In the NBA and <unk>, the boundaries of the half closer to the basket is traced in a broken line in order to space players properly for jump balls. NBA Rule 1 ( g ) requires the key to contain two 6 inches ( 15 cm ) long <unk> marks, 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) from the free throw line ; the marks indicate the so @-@ called lower defensive box. The free @-@ throw line is 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) from the perpendicular projection of the face of the <unk> onto the court ; this projection is 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) from the end @-@ line for NBA and NCAA.

The few Polish films permitted to be shown ( about 20 % of the total programming ) were edited to eliminate references to Polish national symbols as well as Jewish actors and producers. Several propaganda films were shot in Polish, although no Polish films were shown after 1943. As all profits from Polish cinemas were officially directed toward German war production, attendance was discouraged by the Polish underground ; a famous underground slogan declared : " <unk> <unk> <unk> w <unk> " ( " Only pigs attend the movies " ). A similar situation faced theaters, which were forbidden by the Germans to produce " serious " <unk>. Indeed, a number of propaganda pieces were created for theater stages. Hence, theatrical productions were also boycotted by the underground. In addition, actors were discouraged from performing in them and warned that they would be labeled as collaborators if they failed to comply. Ironically, restrictions on cultural performances were eased in Jewish ghettos, given that the Germans wished to distract <unk> inhabitants and prevent them from grasping their eventual fate.

After leaving Paterson the highway travels north through rural farm land as a two @-@ lane highway. A few minor roads are intersected before the roadway turns to the west after about 17 mi ( 27 km ), before turning back to the north. After the highway resumes its northerly course it climbs into the Horse Heaven Hills, gaining a passing lane through the uphill segments, before finally terminating at SR 22 in south Prosser. 
<|endoftext|> Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year.

Although it was already a depression, advisories on the storm were not issued until August 30, five days after its formation. For several days, the depression maintained its intensity as it steadily tracked west across the Atlantic. It eventually attained tropical storm intensity on August 28. Despite the lack of aircraft reconnaissance in the region, the intensity was determined by wind readings from a German cargo ship that passed through the storm.

Three days later, Christine attained its peak intensity just below hurricane @-@ status with winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) and a minimum pressure of 996 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 41 inHg ). Shortly thereafter, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken as it neared the Leeward Islands. As it passed over Antigua on September 3, Christine weakened to a tropical depression and eventually dissipated near the Dominican Republic later that day. 
<|endoftext|> During its passage through the Leeward Islands, Christine produced torrential rainfall, peaking at 11 @.@ 74 in ( 298 mm ) in southeastern Puerto Rico. These rains led to flooding on several islands. One person was killed during the storm after being <unk> by a downed power line on a flooded road. Schools were closed ahead of the storm in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands as a precaution following the issuance of flood warnings.

In an interview for MTV News, Mandler said that " Man Down " required " a strong narrative and visual " and that fans could expect something " dramatic and shocking and intense and emotions and <unk> and enlightening ".

" In the chapter titled " <unk> : Black Women's Resistance to Sexual Violence ", Hobson explores how black women have " found the courage " to speak out about sexual violence, protest against it and not remain a silent victim. She recalled Rihanna's interview for 20 / 20 with Diane Sawyer, which aired on November 6, 2009. Having remained silent about her altercation with Brown on the evening of the Grammy Party in February that year, whereby Brown assaulted her, Rihanna decided to speak about it for the first time. The author noted how Sawyer decided to approach the interview by presenting the couples relationship and assault case as an " anomaly " and accused Rihanna of " projecting a'fake'imagery of strong black woman ", rather than presenting her another domestic violence victim not only in the United States, but in the world. " I am strong, " Rihanna responded. Hobson wrote that from then on, the singer decided to project an image of " hardcore <unk> and <unk> @-@ type femininity in her music trajectory ". 
<|endoftext|> Subsequently, several of Rihanna's songs and music videos have <unk> controversy for their violent themes, which Hobson attributes to the leaking of a photo showing the singers " battered face " on the evening of the assault by <unk> which circulated the internet without the permission of Rihanna. Hobson writes : " Because of this, Rihanna has had to <unk> back control of the'victim'image <unk> on her, and she in turn has challenged us <unk> and visually to question and examine the power, danger, and <unk> that shape our relationships. " She continued to highlight the music videos for " Russian <unk> ", " Hard ", " We Found Love ", " Love the Way You Lie " with Eminem which documents domestic violence, and " S & M ", which contains references to bondage and <unk> and is, in part, Rihanna's response to disparaging critics, as examples. At one point in the video for " S & M ", Rihanna is literally tied up as a victim. 
<|endoftext|> However, Hobson noted that Rihanna " rejects the victim stance " in the video for " Man Down ", and <unk> that she played the role of a rape survivor who shot her attacker. She attributed the location of shooting the video in Jamaica as significant, due to how the image of a gun <unk> during 1990s Jamaican dance hall's to " express female rage ". The <unk> depicts Rihanna as a " dark @-@ hooded " <unk> <unk> whereby the narrative explains her motives for murder and <unk> the <unk> to <unk> with her because she danced in a provocative manner with a man in a club, which Hobson suggests is " somehow <unk> of rape ".

Hornung's original stories have undergone a number of reprints, and when all the short stories were published in a single volume, Graham Greene considered it " a splendid idea ". In 1975 Greene had written a play based on the Raffles stories, The Return of <unk> Raffles, which premiered at the Royal Shakespeare Company, with <unk> Elliott as Raffles. 
<|endoftext|> There were several Raffles films made during Hornung's lifetime, Further films followed in the years after his death, including Raffles, the Amateur Cracksman ( 1925 ), with House Peters, Sr. ; Raffles ( 1930 ), featuring Ronald Colman ; The Return of Raffles ( 1933 ), with George <unk> ; and Raffles ( 1939 ), starring David Niven ; the last of these was a Samuel Goldwyn Productions remake of their own 1930 film, which the academic Victor E. <unk> called the " most memorable portrayal " of the character.

Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners.

<|endoftext|> Of Human Feelings received considerable acclaim from contemporary critics.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> As early as 1837, a visitor to the Everglades suggested the value of the land without the water : 
<|endoftext|> Could it be drained by deepening the natural outlets? Would it not open to cultivation immense tracts of rich vegetable soil? Could the <unk>, obtained by draining, be improved to any useful purpose? Would such draining render the country unhealthy?... Many queries like these passed through our minds. They can only be solved by a thorough examination of the whole country. Could the waters be lowered ten feet, it would probably drain six hundred thousand acres ; should this prove to be a rich soil, as would seem probable, what a field it would open for tropical productions! What facilities for commerce! 
<|endoftext|> Territorial representative David Levy proposed a resolution that was passed in Congress in 1842 : " that the Secretary of War be directed to place before this House such information as can be obtained in relation to the <unk> and probable expense of draining the everglades of Florida. " From this directive Secretary of the Treasury Robert J. Walker requested Thomas Buckingham Smith from St. Augustine to consult those with experience in the Everglades on the feasibility of draining them, saying that he had been told two or three canals to the Gulf of Mexico would be sufficient. Smith asked officers who had served in the Seminole Wars to respond, and many favored the idea, promoting the land as a future agricultural asset to the South. A few disagreed, such as Captain John Sprague, who wrote he " never supposed the country would excite an inquiry, other than as a hiding place for Indians, and had it occurred to me that so great an undertaking, one so utterly <unk>, as draining the Ever Glades was to be discussed, I should not have destroyed the scratch of pen upon a subject so fruitful, and which cannot be understood but by those who have <unk> the water belly deep and examined carefully the western coast by land and by water. " 
<|endoftext|> Nevertheless, Smith returned a report to the Secretary of the Treasury asking for $ 500 @,@ 000 to do the job. The report is the first published study on the topic of the Everglades, and concluded with the statement : 
<|endoftext|> The Ever Glades are now suitable only for the haunt of <unk> <unk> or the resort of <unk> reptiles. The statesman whose <unk> shall cause the millions of acres they contain, now worse than worthless, to <unk> with the products of agricultural industry ; that man who thus adds to the resources of his country... will merit a high place in public favor, not only with his own generation, but with <unk>. He will have created a State! 
<|endoftext|> Smith suggested cutting through the rim of the Everglades ( known today as the Atlantic Coastal Ridge ), connecting the heads of rivers to the coastline so that 4 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) of water would be drained from the area. The result, Smith hoped, would yield farmland suitable for corn, sugar, rice, cotton, and tobacco.

<|endoftext|> During the summer of 1984, Cherry made the two key signings of central defender Dave Evans and right winger John Hendrie to build on the previous season's high finish. McCall was an integral part of the team as City won the Division Three championship in 1984 – 85, during which he scored eight goals as one of two ever @-@ present players.

After the fire, McCall, still in his kit, spent several hours driving from the ground to his sister's house, then to Bradford Royal <unk> and <unk> Hospital trying to find his father. His father had suffered severe burns and needed skin <unk> on his hands and head and was in hospital for several weeks.

During Bradford's time away from Valley Parade, McCall also turned his back on Leeds United, the team he had supported as a child, after their fans set fire to a chip van at <unk> Stadium. McCall became club captain in November 1986, aged just 21, after Peter Jackson moved to Newcastle United. Under Cherry's replacement, Terry Dolan, the club held off any relegation threats to finish tenth in 1986 – 87. Like Jackson, McCall and Hendrie were both keen to move to a Division One club, but they agreed in 1987 to stay for one final season.

In The Feast of the Goat, Vargas Llosa imagines the innermost thoughts of the dictator, and retells The Goat's last hours from his own perspective. Trujillo's character struggles with aging and the physical problems of <unk> and impotence.

The resultant economic downturn, in conjunction with other factors, leads to the CIA supported assassination plot that ends Trujillo's life on May 30, 1961. 
<|endoftext|> Trujillo's regime is supported by Johnny Abbes García, the head of the Military Intelligence Service ( SIM ), a brutal man to whom many " <unk>,... executions,... sudden falls into disgrace " are attributed.

As the battalion was brought up to its authorised strength of around 800 men, personnel were formed into four machine gun companies,'A'to'D ', under a headquarters company consisting of several specialist platoons — including signals and anti @-@ aircraft platoons — and battalion headquarters. There were no platoon commanders until a contingent arrived from the regional Officer Training Units. Initially training was hampered by a lack of equipment — only 12 of 48 Vickers machine guns assigned to the battalion were available — so at the start the focus was on individual rather than collective training. As more stores arrived, training accelerated with the help of experienced Militia NCOs and First World War veterans, who were brought in to share their experiences with the new troops.

As a result of concerns about Japanese intentions in the region, the decision was made to move the brigade north to bolster the defences around Darwin in the Northern Territory. In the event of fighting in the Pacific, the government planned to split infantry battalions, to defend the island chain to Australia ’ s north, dispatching forces to Rabaul, Ambon and Timor. The role of the corps troops from the 2 / 4th Pioneers and 2 / 4th Machine Gun Battalion remained uncertain.

<|endoftext|> Though breeding can be improved by supplementary feeding, the survival of young kakapo is hampered by the presence of Polynesian rats. Of 21 chicks that hatched between 1981 and 1994, nine were either killed by rats or died and were subsequently eaten by rats. Nest protection has been intensified since 1995 by using traps and poison stations as soon as a nest had been detected. A small video camera and <unk> @-@ red light source watch the nest continuously, and will scare approaching rats with flashing lights and loud popping sounds. To increase the success rate of nesting, a nest <unk> places a small <unk> controlled electric blanket over the eggs or chicks, whenever the female leaves the nest for food. The survival rate of chicks has increased from 29 % in unprotected nests to 75 % in protected ones. 
<|endoftext|> To monitor the kakapo population continuously, each bird is equipped with a radio <unk>. Every known kakapo, barring some young chicks, has been given a name by Kakapo Recovery Programme officials. It is an affectionate way for conservation staff to refer to individual birds, and a stark reminder of how few remain. Artificial incubation of eggs and hand @-@ raising of chicks have often been used to improve the condition of the eggs and chicks. In November 2005, the population comprised 41 females and 45 males, including four fledglings ( 3 females and 1 male ) bred in 2005. The oldest known kakapo, " Richard Henry ", was thought to be 80 years old at the time of his death in December 2010. 
<|endoftext|> In 2006, the Kakapo Recovery Programme presented a new management plan that would run from 2006 to 2016. The key goals of this plan are to increase the female population to at least 60 by 2016, increase genetic diversity, maintain or restore a sufficiently large habitat to accommodate the expected increase in the kakapo population, and maintain public awareness and support. 
<|endoftext|> The Kakapo Recovery programme has been successful, with the numbers of kakapo increasing steadily. Adult survival rate and <unk> have both improved significantly since the programme's inception. However, the main goal is to establish at least one viable, self @-@ sustaining, unmanaged population of kakapo as a functional component of the ecosystem in a protected habitat. To help meet this conservation challenge, two large Fiordland islands, Resolution ( 20 @,@ 860 ha ) and Secretary ( 8 @,@ 140 ha ), have been prepared for re @-@ introduction of the kakapo with large @-@ scale ecological restoration activities. Ultimately, the Kakapo Recovery vision for the species is to restore the " <unk> " ( <unk> for " life @-@ force " ) of the kakapo by breeding 150 adult females. 
<|endoftext|> During the 2008 – 2009 summer breeding season, the total population of kakapo rose to over 100 for the first time since monitoring began, reaching 123 by February 2012. Twenty two of the 34 chicks had to be hand @-@ reared because of a shortage of food on Codfish Island. 
<|endoftext|> In 2012, seven kakapo were transferred to Little Barrier Island, in an attempt to establish a successful breeding programme. Kakapo were last on the island in 1999. 
<|endoftext|> In March 2014, with the kakapo population having increased to 126, the bird's recovery was used by Melbourne artist <unk> <unk> as a metaphor for the recovery of <unk>, <unk> the " <unk> spirit of these two communities and their determination to rebuild ".

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The kakapo is associated with a rich tradition of Māori folklore and beliefs. The bird's irregular breeding cycle was understood to be associated with heavy fruiting or " <unk> " events of particular plant species such as the <unk> which led Māori to credit the bird with the ability to tell the future. Used to <unk> this claim were reported observations of these birds dropping the berries of the <unk> and <unk> trees ( when they were in season ) into secluded pools of water to preserve them as a food supply for the summer ahead ; in legend this became the origin of the Māori practice of <unk> food in water for the same purpose.

Developers were sued and arrested for mail fraud when people who had spent their life savings to buy land arrived in south Florida expecting to find a dry parcel of land to build upon and instead found it completely underwater. Advertisements promised land that would yield crops in eight weeks, but for many it took at least as long just to clear. Some burned off the sawgrass or other vegetation only to discover that the underlying peat continued to burn. Animals and <unk> used for <unk> got <unk> in the muck and were useless. When the muck dried, it turned to a fine black powder and created dust storms. Settlers encountered rodents, <unk>, and biting insects, and faced dangers from mosquitoes, poisonous snakes and alligators. Though at first crops <unk> quickly and <unk>, they just as quickly <unk> and died, seemingly without reason. It was discovered later that the peat and muck lacked copper and other trace elements.

<|endoftext|> With the increasing population in towns near the Everglades came hunting opportunities. Even decades earlier, Harriet <unk> <unk> had been horrified at the hunting by visitors, and she wrote the first conservation publication for Florida in 1877 : " [ t ] he decks of boats are crowded with men, whose only feeling amid our magnificent forests, seems to be a wild desire to shoot something and who fire at every living thing on shore. " <unk> and raccoons were the most widely hunted for their skins. Otter pelts could fetch between $ 8 and $ 15 each. <unk>, more plentiful, only warranted 75 cents each in 1915. Hunting often went unchecked ; on one trip, a Lake Okeechobee hunter killed 250 alligators and 172 otters. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> birds were a particular target. Their feathers were used in women's hats from the late 19th century until the 1920s. In 1886, five million birds were estimated to have been killed for their feathers. They were usually shot in the spring, when their feathers were colored for mating and nesting. <unk>, as the plumes were called in the <unk> business, sold in 1915 for $ 32 an <unk>, also the price of gold. <unk> was a $ 17 @-@ million @-@ a @-@ year industry that motivated plume <unk> to lie in wait at the nests of <unk> and other large birds during the nesting season, shoot the parents with small @-@ bore rifles, and leave the chicks to <unk>. Many hunters refused to participate after watching the gruesome results of a plume hunt. Still, plumes from Everglades wading birds could be found in Havana, New York City, London, and Paris. A dealer in New York paid at least 60 hunters to provide him with " almost anything that wore feathers, but particularly the Herons, <unk>, and <unk> birds ". Hunters could collect plumes from a hundred birds on a good day. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> harvesting became a dangerous business. The <unk> Society became concerned with the amount of hunting being done in <unk> in the mangrove forests. In 1902, they hired a <unk>, Guy Bradley, to watch the <unk> around <unk> Lake. Bradley had lived in <unk> within the Everglades, and was murdered in 1905 by one of his neighbors after he tried to prevent him from hunting. Protection of birds was the reason for establishing the first wildlife refuge when President Theodore Roosevelt set Pelican Island as a sanctuary in 1903. 
<|endoftext|> In the 1920s, after birds were protected and alligators hunted nearly to extinction, Prohibition created a living for those willing to smuggle alcohol into the U.S. from Cuba. Rum @-@ runners used the vast Everglades as a hiding spot : there were never enough law enforcement officers to patrol it. The advent of the fishing industry, the arrival of the railroad, and the discovery of the benefits of adding copper to Okeechobee muck soon created unprecedented numbers of residents in new towns like Moore Haven, <unk>, and Belle Glade.

<|endoftext|> The episode was designed to be the most humorous of Torchwood's second series and incorporated elements of broad comedy and soap opera style storytelling to the monster of the week story. It was filmed largely on location in South Wales — prominent locations included the tourist attractions Margam Country Park and <unk> Gardens — and featured an ensemble of previously unseen Welsh characters. The episode was seen by an aggregated total of 4 @.@ 76 million viewers across its three debut showings in the United Kingdom. Critical response was extremely mixed.

Gwen's <unk> Rhys ( Kai Owen ) also tries to postpone the wedding in Gwen's interest but Gwen insists that the wedding go ahead as she desires nothing more than to marry him. The sudden pregnancy is explained to Gwen and Rhys'families as their own child. Gwen's mother ( Sharon Morgan ) and father ( William Thomas ) are excited at the prospect of a <unk>, but Rhys'parents suspect Gwen of being pregnant by another man. Torchwood agent Toshiko Sato ( Naoko Mori ) is sent to the wedding venue to keep an eye on Gwen and to deliver a new wedding dress to accommodate her alien pregnancy. 
<|endoftext|> At Torchwood's Cardiff headquarters, Owen determines from an autopsy that the alien that impregnated Gwen is a Nostrovite, a race of carnivorous shape <unk> who hunt in pairs and mate for life. He tells Jack that after fertilisation, the female transfers her eggs to the male who plants them in a host body until they are ready to hatch. Later, the female kills the host to release the offspring. At the wedding venue, the female Nostrovite ( <unk> Brown ) murders and partly <unk> wedding guest Mervyn. Toshiko investigates along with Rhys'best man " Banana Boat " ( Jonathan Lewis Owen ) and they are subsequently captured by the alien, who intends to feed on them later.

<|endoftext|> Puritans'opponents were placed in high positions of authority, most notably William Laud who was made Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633, even though these " high churchmen " were in the minority. Puritans were forced to keep their views private or face fines and imprisonment. Laud promoted advocates of <unk>, a theological perspective opposed to the Reformed theology of the Puritans. Worship practices such as kneeling at communion, <unk> at the name of Christ, and the placement of communion tables at the East end of churches were also reinstated. To the Puritans, these seemed to be a step in the direction of Catholicism. 
<|endoftext|> There were also conflicts between the king and the Scots, whose church was ruled by a system of elected assemblies called presbyterianism. James, Charles's predecessor as King of Scotland, made it clear that he intended to impose elements of episcopal church government and the Book of Common Prayer on the Scots beginning in 1604. The Scots considered this a <unk> to Roman Catholicism. Charles furthered English <unk> on the Church of Scotland in <unk> and 1637. This led to the First Bishops'War between Charles and the Scots in 1639. Charles called what came to be known as the Short Parliament to raise funds for the war, but he soon dissolved it when it began voicing opposition to his policies. Following the Second Bishops'War with the Scots in 1640, Charles was forced to call another parliament to raise additional funds. 
<|endoftext|> What came to be known as the Long Parliament also began to voice vague grievances against Charles, many of which were religious in nature. Parliament had many Puritans and Puritan @-@ <unk> members, who generally opposed the existing episcopal system, but there was little agreement over what shape the church should take. Later in 1640, the Root and Branch petition was presented to the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament. It was signed by about 15 @,@ 000 <unk> and called for total elimination of the episcopal system. Committees were organized in the House of Commons to enact religious reforms, leading to the imprisonment of Archbishop Laud and his supporters in the Tower of London as retaliation for their repression of Puritans. The Court of High Commission and the Star Chamber, courts which had inflicted severe punishments on Puritan dissenters, were also abolished. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Calling the assembly = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The idea of a national assembly of theologians to advise Parliament on further church reforms was first presented to the House of Commons in 1641. Such a proposal was also included in the Grand <unk>, a list of grievances which Parliament presented to Charles on 1 December that year. Charles responded on 23 December that the church required no reforms. <unk>, Parliament passed three bills in 1642 appointing an assembly and <unk> that its members would be chosen by Parliament. Charles, whose royal assent was required for the bills to become law, was only willing to consider such an assembly if the members were chosen by the clergy. This was the practice for selection of members of <unk>, the assembly of clergy of the Church of England. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> the king, between 12 February and 20 April 1642, each county delegation of England in Commons chose two divines, in addition to two for each county of Wales, four for London, and two for each University ( Oxford and Cambridge ). County <unk> often chose divines from their own county, but not always. Commons chose the members in this way to ensure that their local constituencies were represented in the decision. The House of Lords, Parliament's upper house, added another fourteen names on 14 May, to which Commons agreed. Meanwhile, relations continued to deteriorate between the king and Parliament. Charles raised the royal standard at Nottingham on 22 August, marking the beginning of the First English Civil War. The start of the war lent support to the cause of the Assembly in Parliament, because holding it would convince the Scots that Parliament was serious about reforming the church and induce the Scots to come to their aid. On the other hand, the war added strain to the already busy Parliament. 
<|endoftext|> Parliament finally passed an ordinance to hold the assembly on its own authority without Charles's assent on 12 June 1643. It named as many as 121 ministers and thirty non @-@ voting parliamentary observers : twenty from Commons, and ten from the House of Lords. The Assembly was almost entirely English ; Parliament appointed Englishmen for the counties of Wales, but the French stranger churches ( churches of Protestant refugees from Catholic France ) sent two ministers in place of any from the Channel Islands. Many of the divines were internationally recognized scholars of the Bible, ancient languages, <unk>, and scholastic theology. Many were also famous preachers. Most of these theologians had retained their positions in the Church during the tenure of William Laud. Some had been ejected from their churches or cited by ecclesiastical courts for their

Anekāntavāda, thus, did not prevent the Jain thinkers from defending the truth and validity of their own doctrine while simultaneously <unk> and understanding the rival doctrines. Anne <unk> notes that the epistemological respect for other viewpoints was put to practice when she was invited by Ācārya Tulsi, the head of the <unk> order, to teach <unk> the tenets of Christianity. Commenting on their adherence to ahiṃsā and anekāntavāda, she says : 
<|endoftext|> The Jain <unk> of <unk> <unk> maintain ahiṃsā to be an eternal and <unk> moral law. Other views and beliefs that contradict this belief would certainly be challenged, and ultimately rejected. But what is significant, is that both the rejection and retention of views is tempered by the belief that our perception conveys only a partial reality, that reality itself is <unk>, and that to assume one particular viewpoint is final, is to hold a limited picture of reality. 
<|endoftext|> Anekāntavāda is also different from moral relativism. It does not mean <unk> that all arguments and all views are equal, but rather logic and evidence determine which views are true, in what respect and to what extent ( as truth in relativism, itself ). While employing anekāntavāda, the 17th century philosopher monk, <unk> <unk> also <unk> against <unk> ( indiscriminate attachment to all views as being true ), which is effectively a kind of <unk> relativism. Jains thus consider anekāntavāda as a positive concept corresponding to religious pluralism that <unk> monism and dualism, implying a sophisticated conception of a complex reality. It does not merely involve rejection of <unk>, but reflects a positive spirit of reconciliation of opposite views. However, it is argued that pluralism often <unk> to some form of moral relativism or religious <unk>. According to Anne <unk>, anekānta is a way out of this epistemological <unk>, as it makes a genuinely <unk> view possible without <unk> into extreme moral relativism or exclusivity.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The ancient Jain texts often explain the concepts of <unk> and syādvāda with the parable of the blind men and an elephant ( <unk> ), which addresses the <unk> nature of truth. 
<|endoftext|> A group of blind men heard that a strange animal, called an elephant, had been brought to the town, but none of them were aware of its shape and form. Out of curiosity, they said : " We must inspect and know it by touch, of which we are capable ". So, they sought it out, and when they found it they <unk> about it. In the case of the first person, whose hand landed on the trunk, said " This being is like a drain pipe ". For another one whose hand reached its ear, it seemed like a kind of fan. As for another person, whose hand was upon its leg, said, " I perceive the shape of the elephant to be like a pillar ". And in the case of the one who placed his hand upon its back said, " Indeed, this elephant is like a throne ". Now, each of these presented a true aspect when he related what he had gained from experiencing the elephant. None of them had <unk> from the true description of the elephant. Yet they fell short of <unk> the true appearance of the elephant. 
<|endoftext|> Two of the many references to this parable are found in <unk> of <unk> ( 9th century ) and <unk> of Ācārya Mallisena ( 13th century ). Mallisena uses the parable to argue that immature people deny various aspects of truth ; <unk> by the aspects they do understand, they deny the aspects they don 't understand. " Due to extreme delusion produced on account of a partial viewpoint, the immature deny one aspect and try to establish another. This is the <unk> of the blind ( men ) and the elephant. " Mallisena also cites the parable when noting the importance of considering all viewpoints in obtaining a full picture of reality. " It is impossible to properly understand an entity consisting of infinite properties without the method of modal description consisting of all viewpoints, since it will otherwise lead to a situation of seizing mere <unk> ( i.e., a superficial, inadequate cognition ), on the <unk> of the blind ( men ) and the elephant.

Kennedy suggests that " The castle scientifically designed as a fighting machine surely reached its <unk> in great buildings like Margat and Crac des Chevaliers. " 
<|endoftext|> Krak des Chevaliers can be classified both as a spur castle, due to its site, and after the 13th @-@ century expansion a fully developed concentric castle. It was similar in size and layout to <unk> Jacob, a Crusader castle built in the late <unk>. Margat has also been cited as Krak des Chevaliers'sister castle. The main building material at Krak des Chevaliers was limestone ; the ashlar facing is so fine that the mortar is barely noticeable. Outside the castle's entrance was a " walled suburb " known as a <unk>, no trace of which remains. To the south of the outer ward was a triangular <unk> and the Crusaders may have intended to build stone walls and towers around it. It is unknown how it was defended at the time of the 1271 siege, though it has been suggested it was surrounded by a timber palisade. South of the castle the spur on which it stands is connected to the next hill, so that siege engines can approach on level ground. The inner defences are strongest at this point, with a cluster of towers connected by a thick wall.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Between 1142 and 1170 the Knights Hospitaller undertook a building programme on the site. The castle was defended by a stone curtain wall studded with square towers which projected slightly. The main entrance was between two towers on the eastern side, and there was a <unk> gate in the northwest tower. At the center was a courtyard surrounded by vaulted chambers. The lay of the land dictated the castle's irregular shape. A site with natural defences was a typical location for Crusader castles and steep slopes provided Krak des Chevaliers with defences on all sides bar one, where the castle's defences were concentrated. This phase of building was incorporated into the later castle's construction. 
<|endoftext|> When Krak des Chevaliers was remodelled in the 13th century, new walls surrounding the inner court were built. They followed the earlier walls, with a narrow gap between them in the west and south which was turned into a gallery from which defenders could <unk> missiles. In this area, the walls were supported by a steeply sloping glacis which provided additional protection against both siege weapons and earthquakes. Four large, round towers project vertically from the glacis ; they were used as accommodation for the Knights of the garrison, about 60 at its peak. The southwest tower was designed to house the rooms of the Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller. Though the defences which once crested the walls of the inner wards no longer survive in most places, it seems that they did not extend for the entire circuit. <unk> were absent from the southern face. The area between the inner court and the outer walls was narrow and not used for accommodation. In the east, where the defences were weakest, there was an open cistern filled by an <unk>. It acted both as a <unk> and water supply for the castle.

Contemporary reviews all praised the play's humour, though some were cautious about its explicit lack of social messages, while others <unk> the modern consensus that it was the culmination of Wilde's artistic career so far. Its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make The Importance of Being Earnest Wilde's most <unk> popular play. 
<|endoftext|> The successful opening night marked the climax of Wilde's career but also heralded his downfall. The Marquess of Queensberry, whose son Lord Alfred Douglas was Wilde's lover, planned to present the writer with a bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show. Wilde was tipped off and Queensberry was refused admission. Soon afterwards their feud came to a climax in court, where Wilde's homosexual double life was revealed to the Victorian public and he was eventually sentenced to imprisonment. His notoriety caused the play, despite its early success, to be closed after 86 performances. After his release, he published the play from exile in Paris, but he wrote no further comic or dramatic work. 
<|endoftext|> The Importance of Being Earnest has been revived many times since its premiere. It has been adapted for the cinema on three occasions. In The Importance of Being Earnest ( 1952 ), Dame Edith Evans reprised her celebrated interpretation of Lady Bracknell ; The Importance of Being Earnest ( 1992 ) by Kurt Baker used an all @-@ black cast ; and Oliver Parker's The Importance of Being Earnest ( 2002 ) incorporated some of Wilde's original material cut during the preparation of the original stage production.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> After the success of Wilde's plays Lady Windermere's Fan and A Woman of No Importance, Wilde's producers urged him to write further plays. In July 1894 he <unk> his idea for The Importance of Being Earnest to George Alexander, the actor @-@ manager of the St James's Theatre. Wilde spent the summer with his family at Worthing, where he wrote the play quickly in August. His fame now at its peak, he used the working title Lady <unk> to avoid pre @-@ <unk> speculation of its content. Many names and ideas in the play were borrowed from people or places the author had known ; Lady Queensberry, Lord Alfred Douglas's mother, for example, lived at Bracknell. There is widespread agreement among Wilde scholars that the most important influence on the play was W. S. Gilbert's 1877 farce <unk> ; Wilde borrowed from Gilbert not only several incidents but, in Russell Jackson's phrase " the gravity of tone demanded by Gilbert of his actors ". 
<|endoftext|> Wilde continually revised the text over the next months : no line was left <unk>, and " in a play so economical with its language and effects, [ the revisions ] had serious consequences ". <unk> <unk> describes Wilde's revisions as a refined art at work : the earliest, longest handwritten drafts of the play labour over farcical incidents, broad puns, nonsense dialogue and conventional comic turns. In revising as he did, " Wilde transformed standard nonsense into the more systemic and disconcerting <unk> which <unk> Earnest's dialogue ". Richard Ellmann argues that Wilde had reached his artistic maturity and wrote this work more surely and rapidly than before. 
<|endoftext|> Wilde hesitated about submitting the script to Alexander, worrying that it might be unsuitable for the St James's Theatre, whose typical repertoire was relatively serious, and explaining that it had been written in response to a request for a play " with no real serious interest ". When Henry James's Guy <unk> failed, Alexander turned to Wilde and agreed to put on his play. Alexander began his usual meticulous preparations, <unk> the author on each line and planning stage movements with a toy theatre. In the course of these rehearsals Alexander asked Wilde to shorten the play from four acts to three. Wilde agreed and combined elements of the second and third acts. The largest cut was the removal of the character of Mr. <unk>, a solicitor who comes from London to arrest the <unk> " Ernest " ( i.e., Jack ) for his unpaid dining bills. Algernon, who is posing as " Ernest ", will be led away to Holloway <unk> unless he settles his accounts immediately. Jack finally agrees to pay for Ernest, everyone thinking that it is Algernon's bill when in fact it is his own.

During his travels, Innis supplemented his fur research by gathering information on other staple products such as lumber, pulp and paper, minerals, grain and fish. He travelled so extensively that by the early 1940s, he had visited every part of Canada except for the Western Arctic and the east side of Hudson Bay.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Fur trade in Canada = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Harold Innis's interest in the relationship between empires and colonies was developed in his classic study, The Fur Trade in Canada : An Introduction to Canadian Economic History ( 1930 ). The book chronicles the trade in beaver fur from the early 16th century to the 1920s. Instead of focusing on the " heroic " European adventurers who explored the Canadian wilderness as conventional histories had done, Innis documents how the interplay of geography, technology and economic forces shaped both the fur trade and Canada's political and economic destiny. He concludes that the fur trade largely determined Canada's boundaries adding that the country " emerged not in spite of geography but because of it ". 
<|endoftext|> The Fur Trade in Canada also describes the cultural interactions among three groups of people : the Europeans in fashionable metropolitan centres who regarded beaver hats as luxury items ; the European colonial settlers who saw beaver fur as a staple that could be exported to pay for essential manufactured goods from the home country, and First Nations peoples who traded furs for industrial goods such as metal pots, knives, guns and liquor. Innis describes the central role First Nations peoples played in the development of the fur trade. Without their skilled hunting techniques, knowledge of the territory and advanced tools such as <unk>, <unk> and birch @-@ bark canoes, the fur trade would not have existed. However, dependence on European technologies disrupted First Nations societies. " The new technology with its radical innovations ", Innis writes, " brought about such a rapid shift in the prevailing Indian culture as to lead to wholesale destruction of the peoples concerned by warfare and disease. " Historian Carl Berger argues that by placing First Nations culture at the centre of his analysis of the fur trade, Innis " was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of native society under the thrust of European capitalism. " 
<|endoftext|> Unlike many historians who see Canadian history as beginning with the arrival of Europeans, Innis emphasizes the cultural and economic contributions of First Nations peoples. " We have not yet realized, " he writes, " that the Indian and his culture was fundamental to the growth of Canadian institutions. " 
<|endoftext|> The Fur Trade in Canada concludes by arguing that Canadian economic history can best be understood by examining how one staple product gave way to another — furs to timber, for example, and the later importance of wheat and minerals. <unk> on staples made Canada economically dependent on more <unk> advanced countries and the " cyclonic " shifts from one staple to another caused frequent disruptions in the country's economic life. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Cod fishery = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> After the publication of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple — the <unk> fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries : The History of an International Economy published in 1940, 10 years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a <unk> natural resource — a history that ranges over 500 years. While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its <unk> rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far @-@ reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Harold Innis's study of the effects of interconnected lakes and rivers on Canadian development and European empire sparked his interest in the complex economic and cultural relationships between transportation systems and communications.

This research provided an additional crossover point from his work on staple products to his communications studies. Biographer Paul <unk> writes that

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Amylostereaceae species were for a long time classified in the genus Stereum, based primary on the layered structure of the fruit body and the similar physiological activity. Mycologist Jacques Boidin separated <unk> from Stereum in 1958, <unk> this decision by explaining that microscopic differences such as amyloid spores and encrusted cystidia were sufficiently distinct to warrant recognition as a new genus. Although the type species of the genus ( today called A. chailletii ) was initially named <unk> <unk>, the name <unk> had already been used for a genus in the flowering plant family <unk>. Boidin thus chose the genus name Amylostereum, referring to the amyloid spores. 
<|endoftext|> Based on DNA analysis, Boidin in 1998 moved Amylostereum into a new, monotypic family, the Amylostereaceae, which he attributed to the <unk> order. Later studies, however, supported the initial classification in the <unk>. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Classification = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The classification of the Amylostereaceae is not completely resolved. The next closest relatives might be – depending on the research – either Echinodontium <unk> and most other species of the genus Echinodontium, or <unk> <unk>. Most of the previous DNA analysis results suggest a narrow relation to Echinodontium, but several results of studies partially contradict this conclusion. Only the classification to the <unk> is regarded as correct. Some authors have suggested that Amylostereum should be placed in the family <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> The similarities between A. chailletii and A. areolatum have caused some confusion regarding their placement in the genus. As only the size of their fruit bodies differ from each other in appearance, researcher German <unk> <unk> assumed that both are the same species in different age stages. Experiments with pure cultures of the fungi, however, showed that the mycelia of A. chailletii, A. laevigatum and A. ferreum were partially compatible to each other, but the mycelium of A. areolatum was incompatible to other species. Boidin believes that the common ancestor of all Amylostereum fungi used yellowwoods as a host. This genus of conifers was native in Europe until the <unk> and <unk> <unk> ( 66 million to 2 @.@ 6 million years ago ), but became extinct there, so the Amylostereum fungi specialized on other conifers and differentiated into several species. Only A. ferreum specialized on yellowwoods in South America. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> tests as well as molecular analysis indicated that A. areolatum separated very early from other Amylostereum fungi. The other three species separated later from each other and are thus partially compatible to each other. A. ferreum and A. laevigatum produced in 59 % of all cases a common mycelium, A. ferreum and A. chailletii only in 44 %. There is an undescribed species in Amylostereum ; according to DNA analysis, it stands between A. laevigatum and A. ferreum. This is remarkable, as these fungi originated from <unk> ( storing organs of <unk> ) of a North American wood wasp, while A. laevigatum has never been seen as symbiont of wood wasps, neither in North American nor in Europe. The fungus possibly represents a separated species or a <unk> of A. laevigatum.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> During the early years of television, there was some measure of cooperation among the four major U.S. television networks. However, as television grew into a profitable business, an intense rivalry developed between the networks, just as it had in radio. NBC and CBS competed fiercely for viewers and advertising dollars, a contest neither <unk> DuMont nor ABC could hope to win. According to author Dennis <unk>, " NBC tried to make an arrangement with ABC and CBS to destroy the DuMont network. " The plan was for NBC and CBS to exclusively offer ABC their most popular series after they had aired on the bigger networks. ABC would become a network of re @-@ runs, but DuMont would be shut out. ABC president Leonard Goldenson rejected NBC executive David <unk>'s proposal, but " did not report it to the Justice Department ". 
<|endoftext|> DuMont survived the early 1950s only because of WDTV in Pittsburgh, the lone commercial VHF station in what was then the sixth @-@ largest market. WDTV's only competition came from UHF stations and distant stations from <unk>, Pennsylvania ; <unk>, Ohio ; and <unk>, West Virginia. No other commercial VHF station signed on in Pittsburgh until 1957, giving WDTV a de facto monopoly on television in the area. Since WDTV carried secondary affiliations with the other three networks, DuMont used this as a <unk> chip to get its programs cleared in other large markets. 
<|endoftext|> Despite its severe financial <unk>, by 1953, DuMont appeared to be on its way to establishing itself as the third national network. DuMont programs aired live on 16 stations, but it could count on only seven primary stations – its three owned @-@ and @-@ operated stations ( " O & Os " ), plus <unk> @-@ TV in Chicago, <unk> ( channel 11 ) in Los Angeles, <unk> @-@ TV ( channel 2, now <unk> @-@ TV ) in Denver and <unk> @-@ TV ( channel 6, now <unk> ) in Columbus, Ohio. In contrast, ABC had a full complement of five O & Os, augmented by nine primary affiliates. ABC also had a radio network ( it was descended from NBC's Blue Network ) from which to draw talent, affiliate loyalty and a profit stream to subsidize television operations. However, ABC had only 14 primary stations, while CBS and NBC had over 40 each. By 1951, ABC was badly <unk> and on the verge of bankruptcy. That year, the company announced a merger with United Paramount Theaters ( the former theater division of Paramount Pictures, which was spun off as a result of the United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc. <unk> decision ), but it was not until 1953 that the FCC approved the merger. 
<|endoftext|> By this time, DuMont had begun to differentiate itself from NBC and CBS. It allowed its advertisers to choose the locations where their advertising ran, potentially saving them millions of dollars. By contrast, ABC operated like CBS and NBC even though it was only a fourth as large, forcing advertisers to purchase a large " must @-@ buy " list of stations. 
<|endoftext|> ABC's fortunes were dramatically altered in February 1953, when the FCC cleared the way for UPT to buy the network. The merger provided ABC with a badly needed cash infusion, giving it the resources to mount " top shelf " programming and to provide a national television service on a scale approaching that of CBS and NBC. Through UPT president Leonard Goldenson, ABC also gained ties with the Hollywood studios that more than matched those DuMont's

The expressway is named for the nearby Snapper Creek which runs parallel to SR 878. It acts as a spur route of the Don Shula Expressway ( SR 874 ), providing access to U.S. Route 1 ( US 1 ) near South Miami and local access to the eastern Kendall area while bypassing the <unk> district.

The westbound lanes of SR 878, however, pass over SR 874's mainline, and are then given an exclusive carriageway beside the southbound lanes for 0 @.@ 46 miles ( 0 @.@ 74 km ), before merging into SR 874 just north of the Kendall Drive overpass. <unk> motorists from the Don Shula Expressway wishing to exit to Kendall Drive merge into this carriageway before leaving for SR 94 with those vehicles originating from the Snapper Creek Expressway. There is no direct connection for southbound motorists on SR 874 to head east on SR 878 ; likewise, westbound motorists on SR 878 cannot head north along SR 874 directly. 
<|endoftext|> From here, SR 878 heads predominantly eastwards as a four @-@ lane @-@ wide expressway through residential neighborhoods for the remainder of its length, generally lying 0 @.@ 5 miles ( 0 @.@ 80 km ) north of Kendall Drive. After approximately 0 @.@ 4 miles ( 0 @.@ 64 km ), the Snapper Creek Expressway passes through the 87th Avenue toll gantry. It then meets Galloway Road ( SR 973 ) shortly afterwards with a diamond interchange. The expressway then enters <unk> Heights once it crosses SR 973 and remains in that district for the rest of its duration. Just before passing over the <unk> Expressway ( SR 826 ) without an interchange ( approximately 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) east of Galloway Road ), SR 878 meets its second and final toll gantry. 
<|endoftext|> About 0 @.@ 3 miles ( 0 @.@ 48 km ) east of the <unk> Expressway, SR 878 has a partial diamond interchange with Southwest 72nd Avenue, which only allows westbound entry to and eastbound exit from the Snapper Creek Expressway. Immediately afterwards, SR 878 turns to the southeast and prepares to meet its eastern terminus at the South Dixie Highway ( US 1 ) at a surface intersection 0 @.@ 6 miles ( 0 @.@ 97 km ) later, passing under the <unk> line and associated <unk> just before doing so. Traffic heading south along US 1 from eastbound SR 878 moves into a slip lane, while that wishing to head north along US 1 enters it at an oblique angle, aided by traffic signals. The only access onto SR 878 westbound from US 1 is for southbound traffic ; motorists heading north along US 1 are guided to SR 878 by signage along Southwest 67th Avenue and Southwest 80th Street.

<|endoftext|> When the cofferdams were in place and the construction site was drained of water, excavation for the dam foundation began. For the dam to rest on solid rock, it was necessary to remove accumulated erosion soils and other loose materials in the riverbed until sound bedrock was reached. Work on the foundation excavations was completed in June 1933. During this excavation, approximately 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 cu yd ( 1 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 m3 ) of material was removed. Since the dam was an arch @-@ gravity type, the side @-@ walls of the canyon would bear the force of the <unk> lake. Therefore, the side @-@ walls were excavated too, to reach virgin rock as weathered rock might provide pathways for water seepage. 
<|endoftext|> The men who removed this rock were called " high scalers ". While suspended from the top of the canyon with ropes, the high @-@ scalers climbed down the canyon walls and removed the loose rock with <unk> and dynamite. Falling objects were the most common cause of death on the dam site ; the high scalers'work thus helped ensure worker safety. One high <unk> was able to save life in a more direct manner : when a government <unk> lost his grip on a safety line and began tumbling down a slope towards almost certain death, a high <unk> was able to intercept him and pull him into the air. The construction site had, even then, become a magnet for tourists ; the high scalers were prime attractions and showed off for the <unk>. The high scalers received considerable media attention, with one worker dubbed the " Human <unk> " for swinging co @-@ workers ( and, at other times, cases of dynamite ) across the canyon. To protect themselves against falling objects, some high scalers took cloth hats and dipped them in tar, allowing them to harden. When workers wearing such headgear were struck hard enough to inflict broken jaws, they sustained no skull damage, Six Companies ordered thousands of what initially were called " hard boiled hats " ( later " hard hats " ) and strongly encouraged their use. 
<|endoftext|> The cleared, underlying rock foundation of the dam site was reinforced with grout, called a grout curtain. <unk> were driven into the walls and base of the canyon, as deep as 150 feet ( 46 m ) into the rock, and any cavities encountered were to be filled with grout. This was done to stabilize the rock, to prevent water from seeping past the dam through the canyon rock, and to limit " <unk> " — upward pressure from water seeping under the dam. The workers were under severe time constraints due to the beginning of the concrete pour, and when they encountered hot springs or cavities too large to readily fill, they moved on without resolving the problem. A total of 58 of the 393 holes were incompletely filled. After the dam was completed and the lake began to fill, large numbers of significant leaks into the dam caused the Bureau of Reclamation to look into the situation. It found that the work had been incompletely done, and was based on less than a full understanding of the canyon's geology. New holes were drilled from inspection galleries inside the dam into the surrounding bedrock. It took nine years ( 1938 – 47 ) under relative secrecy to complete the supplemental grout curtain.

Since concrete <unk> and contracts as it <unk>, the potential for uneven cooling and contraction of the concrete posed a serious problem. Bureau of Reclamation engineers calculated that if the dam was built in a single continuous pour, the concrete would take 125 years to cool and the resulting stresses would cause the dam to crack and crumble. Instead, the ground where the dam was to rise was marked with <unk>, and concrete blocks in columns were poured, some as large as 50 ft square ( 15 m ) and 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) high. Each five @-@ foot form contained a series of 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) steel pipes through which first cool river water, then later ice @-@ cold water from a <unk> plant was run. When an individual block had cured and had stopped contracting, the pipes were filled with grout. <unk> was also used to fill the hairline spaces between columns, which were grooved to increase the strength of the joins.

In reviewing a Paris show from July 2009, the Sunday Times called " Moment of Surrender " the only track from No Line on the Horizon performed that evening that was strong enough to deserve inclusion with the rest of the show's set list. NME was not as receptive to the song in a live setting, questioning the decision to end concerts with the song. A U2 360 ° Tour performance of " Moment of Surrender " appears on the group's 2010 concert video U2 360 ° at the Rose Bowl. In a review of the film, Andrew Mueller of Uncut called " Moment of Surrender " an " [ i ] ll @-@ chosen closer ", as well as " <unk> and under @-@ realised ".

DAGs can also represent collections of events and their influence on each other, either in a <unk> structure such as a Bayesian network or as a record of historical data such as family trees or the version histories of distributed revision control systems. DAGs can also be used as a compact representation of sequence data, such as the directed acyclic word graph representation of a collection of strings, or the binary decision diagram representation of sequences of binary choices. 
<|endoftext|> Important polynomial time computational problems on DAGs include topological sorting ( finding a topological ordering ), construction of the transitive closure and transitive reduction ( the largest and smallest DAGs with the same reachability relation, respectively ), and the closure problem, in which the goal is to find a minimum @-@ weight subset of vertices with no edges connecting them to the rest of the graph. <unk> a directed graph with cycles into a DAG by <unk> as few vertices or edges as possible ( the feedback vertex set and feedback edge set problem, respectively ) is NP @-@ hard, but any directed graph can be made into a DAG ( its condensation ) by contracting each strongly connected component into a single <unk>. The problems of finding shortest paths and longest paths can be solved on DAGs in linear time, in contrast to arbitrary graphs for which shortest path algorithms are slower and longest path problems are NP @-@ hard. 
<|endoftext|> The corresponding concept for undirected graphs is a forest, an undirected graph without cycles. <unk> an orientation for a forest produces a special kind of directed acyclic graph called a polytree. However there are many other kinds of directed acyclic graph that are not formed by <unk> the edges of an undirected acyclic graph. Moreover, every undirected graph has an acyclic orientation, an assignment of a direction for its edges that makes it into a directed acyclic graph. To emphasize that DAGs are not the same thing as directed versions of undirected acyclic graphs, some authors call them acyclic directed graphs or acyclic <unk>.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> A graph is formed by a collection of vertices and edges, where the vertices are <unk> objects that are connected in pairs by edges. In the case of a directed graph, each edge has an orientation, from one vertex to another vertex. A path in a directed graph can be described by a sequence of edges having the property that the ending vertex of each edge in the sequence is the same as the starting vertex of the next edge in the sequence ; a path forms a cycle if the starting vertex of its first edge equals the ending vertex of its last edge. A directed acyclic graph is a directed graph that has no cycles. 
<|endoftext|> A vertex v of a directed graph is said to be reachable from another vertex u when there exists a path that starts at u and ends at v. As a special case, every vertex is considered to be reachable from itself ( by a path with zero edges ). If a vertex can reach itself via a <unk> path ( a path with one or more edges ), then that path is a cycle, so another way to define directed acyclic graphs is that they are the graphs in which no vertex can reach itself via a <unk> path. 
<|endoftext|> A topological ordering of a directed graph is an ordering of its vertices into a sequence, such that for every edge the start vertex of the edge occurs earlier in the sequence than the ending vertex of the edge. A graph that has a topological ordering cannot have any cycles, because the edge into the earliest vertex of a cycle would have to be oriented the wrong way. Therefore, every graph with a topological ordering is acyclic. Conversely, every directed acyclic graph has a topological ordering. Therefore, this property can be used as an alternative definition of the directed acyclic graphs : they are exactly the graphs that have topological orderings.

Forming out of a tropical disturbance on October 13, Omar initially moved slowly in the eastern Caribbean Sea. By October 15, Omar began to quickly intensify as deep convection developed around the center of circulation. Later that day, an eye developed and the storm began to accelerate to the northeast. Early on October 16, Omar reached its peak intensity with winds of 130 mph ( 215 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of <unk> mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 29 inHg ). Shortly after, the hurricane rapidly weakened to Category 1 intensity.

The remnants of Omar persisted until October 21 at which time it dissipated to the west of the Azores.

They were supported by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps, which worked with the Army Service Corps to supply them with drinking water. In much distress in the <unk> midsummer sands, infantry in the 42nd Division marched very slowly and far in the rear. The 52nd ( Lowland ) Division also experienced difficulties ; although Lawrence ordered the division to move at 06 : 37, the men did not leave their trenches until nearly midday, reaching their objective of Abu Hamra late in the evening.

Although it has been stated that " British reserves <unk> " the Germans and Ottomans to a halt on 5 August, it appears one of the infantry divisions was reluctant to leave their defences ; neither infantry division were trained in desert warfare and found the sand dunes extremely difficult to negotiate.

Nevertheless, his ships inflicted a severe tactical defeat on the French fleet. In the aftermath of the battle both fleets were left shattered ; in no condition for further combat, Howe and Villaret returned to their home ports. Despite losing seven of his ships of the line, Villaret had bought enough time for the French grain convoy to reach safety unimpeded by Howe's fleet, securing a strategic success. However, he was also forced to withdraw his battle fleet back to port, leaving the British free to conduct a campaign of blockade for the remainder of the war. In the immediate aftermath both sides claimed victory and the outcome of the battle was seized upon by the press of both nations as a demonstration of the prowess and bravery of their respective navies.

[ Note B ] A few weeks later, following the execution of the imprisoned King Louis XVI, diplomatic ties between Britain and France were broken. On 1 February France declared war on both Britain and the Dutch Republic. 
<|endoftext|> Protected from immediate invasion by the English Channel, Britain prepared for an extensive naval campaign and dispatched troops to the Netherlands for service against the French. Throughout the remainder of 1793, the British and French navies undertook minor operations in Northern waters, the Mediterranean and the West and East Indies, where both nations maintained colonies. The closest the Channel Fleet had come to an engagement was when it had narrowly missed <unk> the French convoy from the Caribbean, escorted by 15 ships of the line on 2 August. The only major clash was the Siege of Toulon, a confused and bloody affair in which the British force holding the town — alongside Spanish, <unk>, Austrian and French Royalist troops — had to be evacuated by the Royal Navy to prevent its imminent defeat at the hands of the French Republican army. The aftermath of this siege was <unk> by <unk> and accusations of cowardice and betrayal among the allies, eventually resulting in Spain switching allegiance with the signing of the Treaty of San <unk> two years later. Nevertheless, the siege produced one major success : Sir Sidney Smith, with parties of sailors from the retreating British fleet, accomplished the destruction of substantial French naval stores and shipping in Toulon. More might have been achieved had the Spanish raiding parties that accompanied Smith not been issued with secret orders to stall the destruction of the French fleet. 
<|endoftext|> The situation in Europe remained volatile into 1794. Off Northern France, the French Atlantic Fleet had mutinied due to errors in provisions and pay.

The shortage of provisions was more than a navy problem though ; France itself was <unk> because the social upheavals of the previous year had combined with a harsh winter to ruin the harvest. By this time at war with all her neighbours, France had nowhere to turn for overland imports of fresh provisions. Eventually a solution to the food crisis was agreed by the National Convention : food produced in France's overseas colonies would be concentrated on board a fleet of merchant ships gathered in Chesapeake Bay, and augmented with food and goods purchased from the United States. During April and May 1794, the <unk> would convoy the supplies across the Atlantic to Brest, protected by elements of the French Atlantic Fleet.

The recording of the song featured in the video is the version recorded during the Smart Studios sessions. The Sub Pop video features the band walking around various parts of lower Manhattan including the South Street <unk>, the Lower East Side, and Wall Street. While filming the video, Novoselic shaved his head as penance for a bad performance the band gave in New York City. This caused <unk> in the final cut ; shots of the band feature the bassist with and without hair throughout the video. This video was later compiled on the Nirvana box set With the Lights Out ( 2004 ). The audio of this version of " In Bloom " was later released on <unk> of the 20th <unk> Deluxe Edition of the Nevermind album in 2011. 
<|endoftext|> The second video, created to accompany the 1992 single release that was recorded at Sound City Studios, was directed by Kevin Kerslake, who had previously directed the band's videos for " Come as You Are " and " <unk> ". Cobain's original concept for the video told the story of a young girl born into a <unk> <unk> <unk> family who one day realizes how evil they are. His concept was too ambitious, so Cobain instead decided to parody musical performances by bands on early 1960s variety shows, such as The Ed Sullivan Show. The humorous tone of the video was a result of Cobain being " so tired for the last year of people taking us so seriously... I wanted to fuck off and show them that we have a humorous side to us ". Kerslake filmed the video on old <unk> cameras, and the band improvised its performance. The video begins with an unnamed variety show host ( played by Doug Llewelyn, former host of The People's Court ) introducing Nirvana to an in @-@ studio crowd of screaming teenagers ; their non @-@ stop screaming is heard throughout the duration of the song. The band members, whom the host refers to as " thoroughly all right and decent <unk> ", perform dressed in Beach Boys @-@ style outfits ; Cobain wears glasses that blurred his vision, while Novoselic cut his hair short and liked it so much he kept it that way afterwards. As the video progresses, the band destroys the set and its instruments.

Cobain intended to replace the first version of the video after a period with a new take featuring the band wearing dresses instead of suits. MTV's alternative rock show 120 Minutes insisted on <unk> the video, but Cobain felt the program would not properly convey the humor of the " pop idol " version. Instead, a new edit was produced which contained shots of the band in both suits and dresses. The original edit of the video never aired.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Throughout the war Tyrone Guthrie had <unk> to keep the Old Vic company going, even after German bombing in 1942 left the theatre a near @-@ ruin. A small troupe toured the provinces, with Sybil Thorndike at its head. By 1944, with the tide of the war turning, Guthrie felt it time to re @-@ establish the company in a London base and invited Richardson to head it. Richardson made it a condition of accepting that he should share the acting and management in a triumvirate. Initially he proposed Gielgud and Olivier as his colleagues, but the former declined, saying, " It would be a disaster, you would have to spend your whole time as referee between Larry and me. " It was finally agreed that the third member would be the stage director John Burrell. The Old Vic governors approached the Royal Navy to secure the release of Richardson and Olivier ; the Sea Lords consented, with, as Olivier put it, " a <unk> and lack of reluctance which was positively <unk>. " 
<|endoftext|> The triumvirate secured the New Theatre for their first season and recruited a company. Thorndike was joined by, among others, Harcourt Williams, Joyce <unk> and Margaret <unk>. It was agreed to open with a repertory of four plays : <unk> <unk>, Arms and the Man, Richard III and Uncle Vanya. Olivier's roles were the Button <unk>, Sergius, Richard and Astrov ; Richardson played <unk>, <unk>, Richmond and Vanya. The first three productions met with acclaim from reviewers and audiences ; Uncle Vanya had a mixed reception, although The Times thought Olivier's Astrov " a most distinguished portrait " and Richardson's Vanya " the perfect compound of <unk> and pathos ". In Richard III, according to Billington, Olivier's triumph was absolute : " so much so that it became his most frequently imitated performance and one whose supremacy went <unk> until Antony Sher played the role forty years later ". In 1945 the company toured Germany, where they were seen by many thousands of Allied servicemen ; they also appeared at the <unk> @-@ Française theatre in Paris, the first foreign company to be given that honour. The critic Harold Hobson wrote that Richardson and Olivier quickly " made the Old Vic the most famous theatre in the Anglo @-@ Saxon world. " 
<|endoftext|> The second season, in 1945, featured two double bills. The first consisted of Henry IV, Parts 1 and 2. Olivier played the warrior Hotspur in the first and the <unk> Justice <unk> in the second. He received good notices, but by general consent the production belonged to Richardson as Falstaff. In the second double bill it was Olivier who dominated, in the title roles of <unk> Rex and The Critic. In the two one @-@ act plays his switch from searing tragedy and horror in the first half to farcical comedy in the second impressed most critics and audience members, though a minority felt that the transformation from <unk>'s <unk> blinded hero to Sheridan's vain and ludicrous Mr <unk> " <unk> of a quick @-@ change turn in a music hall ". After the London season the company played both the double bills and Uncle Vanya in a six @-@ week run on Broadway. 
<|endoftext|> The third, and final, London season under the triumvirate was in 1946 – 47. Olivier played King Lear, and Richardson took the title role in <unk> de <unk>. Olivier would have preferred the roles to be reversed, but Richardson did not wish to attempt Lear. Olivier's Lear received good but not outstanding reviews. In his scenes of decline and madness towards the end of the play some critics found him less moving than his finest predecessors in the role. The influential critic James Agate suggested that Olivier used his dazzling stage technique to disguise a lack of feeling, a charge that the actor strongly rejected, but which was often made throughout his later career. During the run of <unk>, Richardson was knighted, to Olivier's <unk> envy. The younger man received the accolade six months later, by which time the days of the triumvirate were numbered. The high profile of the two star actors did not <unk> them to the new chairman of the Old Vic governors, Lord Esher. He had ambitions to be the first head of the National Theatre and had no intention of letting actors run it. He was encouraged by Guthrie, who, having instigated the appointment of Richardson and Olivier, had come to resent their <unk> and international fame. 
<|endoftext|> In January 1947 Olivier began working on his second film as a director, Hamlet ( 1948 ), in which he also took the lead role. The original play was

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> At dawn on 29 June, the rebels attacked the Ustaše in a village on the Mostar – Nevesinje road. Prohaska demanded help from Mostar, and planned to send a force from Nevesinje to assist. From Mostar, a company of the 21st Battalion was despatched to relieve the Ustaše, who had managed to hold off the rebels. The Home Guard company then took over the post from the Ustaše. The same day, two new battalions arrived in Mostar, the 23rd Battalion from <unk> and the 15th Battalion from <unk>. These reinforcements arrived just as Prpić received confirmation that Avtovac had been captured by the rebels. The remaining small garrison in Gacko, consisting of only 20 gendarmes and 30 Ustaše, were holding out but expecting more attacks by the rebels. In the morning, the attack by elements of the 10th Battalion stalled until the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel <unk> <unk>, personally took command of the operation, clearing the way for the Italians. The promised Italian intervention commenced about midday, and about 100 trucks of Italian soldiers arrived in Gacko about 17 : 00. As they had passed through Avtovac, the rebels had left the town and withdrawn to villages to the east. About 18 : 00, the 10th Battalion relieved the besieged gendarmes in the village schoolhouse. ZNDH aircraft from Mostar airfield flew reconnaissance sorties over the area and dropped leaflets over Stolac, Stepen, Avtovac, Gacko and Plužine.

<|endoftext|>. The heavy fire of the British fleet forced Scheer to order the fleet to turn away. Due to her reduced speed, Markgraf turned early in an attempt to maintain her place in the battle line ; this, however, forced Grosser Kurfürst to fall out of formation. Markgraf fell in behind Kronprinz while Grosser Kurfürst steamed ahead to return to her position behind König. After successfully withdrawing from the British, Scheer ordered the fleet to assume night cruising formation, though communication errors between Scheer aboard Friedrich der <unk> and <unk>, the lead ship, caused delays. Several British light cruisers and destroyers stumbled into the German line around 21 : 20. In the ensuing short engagement Markgraf hit the cruiser <unk> five times with her secondary guns. The fleet fell into formation by 23 : 30, with Grosser Kurfürst the 13th vessel in the line of 24 capital ships. 
<|endoftext|> Around 02 : 45, several British destroyers mounted a torpedo attack against the rear half of the German line. Markgraf initially held her fire as the identities of the destroyers were unknown. But gunners aboard Grosser Kurfürst correctly identified the vessels as hostile and opened fire while turning away to avoid torpedoes, which prompted Markgraf to follow suit. Heavy fire from the German battleships forced the British destroyers to withdraw. At 05 : 06, Markgraf and several other battleships fired at what they thought was a submarine. 
<|endoftext|> The High Seas Fleet managed to punch through the British light forces without drawing the attention of Jellicoe's battleships, and subsequently reached Horns Reef by 04 : 00 on 1 June. Upon reaching Wilhelmshaven, Markgraf went into harbor while several other battleships took up defensive positions in the outer <unk>. The ship was transferred to Hamburg where she was repaired in AG Vulcan's large floating dock. Repair work was completed by 20 July. In the course of the battle, Markgraf had fired a total of 254 shells from her main battery and <unk> rounds from her 15 cm guns. She was hit by five large @-@ caliber shells, which killed 11 men and wounded 13.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Following repairs in July 1916, Markgraf went into the Baltic for trials. The ship was then temporarily assigned to the I Scouting Group for the fleet operation on 18 – 19 August. Due to the serious damage incurred by Seydlitz and Derfflinger at Jutland, the only battlecruisers available for the operation were Von der <unk> and Moltke, which were joined by Markgraf, Grosser Kurfürst, and the new battleship Bayern. The British were aware of the German plans, and sortied the Grand Fleet to meet them. By 14 : 35, Scheer had been warned of the Grand Fleet's approach and, unwilling to engage the whole of the Grand Fleet just 11 weeks after the <unk> close engagement at Jutland, turned his forces around and retreated to German ports. 
<|endoftext|> Markgraf was present for the uneventful advance in the direction of Sunderland on 18 – 20 October. Unit training with the III Squadron followed from 21 October to 2 November. Two days later, the ship formally rejoined III Squadron. On the 5th, a pair of U @-@ boats grounded on the Danish coast. Light forces were sent to recover the vessels, and III Squadron, which was in the North Sea en route to Wilhelmshaven, was ordered to cover them. During the operation, the British submarine <unk> torpedoed both Grosser Kurfürst and Kronprinz and caused moderate damage. For most of 1917, Markgraf was occupied with guard duties in the North Sea, interrupted only by a refit period in January and periodic unit training in the Baltic.

On 18 September, the order was issued for a joint operation with the army to capture Ösel and Moon Islands ; the primary naval component was to comprise the flagship, Moltke, along with the III and IV Battle Squadrons of the High Seas Fleet.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The construction of Canning Dam ended a long period during which Perth's water supply was generally unsatisfactory in quality ( either due to salinity or bacterial pollution or both ) and in quantity. The project, the biggest public works program of the decade, stimulated significant growth in the local economy and provided desperately needed work for around five hundred men. 
<|endoftext|> Several innovative design concepts and construction methods which were new to Australia were introduced on the project, while others which were used on the nearby Wellington Dam, were improved upon at the Canning dam site. 
<|endoftext|> At the Canning Dam and indeed all dams, care had to be taken to prevent water seepage between the foundation rock and the structure of the dam. At the Canning in addition to cutting back the foundation to solid <unk> rock, a cut @-@ off trench was sited near the upstream face of the dam, down stream which a rock filled drain containing open <unk> pipes was provided to intercept any seepage between the rock face and the concrete of the dam. The inclusion of an internal drainage system was considered innovative at the period. Near vertical tubular 8 in ( 200 mm ) cut @-@ off drains were provided at five @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 52 m ) intervals along the dam to relieve internal seepage through the concrete. 
<|endoftext|> While state of the art materials @-@ handling methods were used, in some instances labour @-@ saving machinery worked beside operations intended to <unk> the labour content. <unk> workers were employed chiefly for on @-@ site preparation, road construction, foundation excavation, clearing timber from the reservoir basin, and on some <unk> operations. <unk> workers were required on the dam for fixing the <unk> where the concrete was poured. These workers were probably employed at normal day labour rates, the main employment method used on the project. <unk> handling of cement was also used for the first time in Australia, this saw a significant saving as opposed to <unk> cement which was the standard practice of the day. 
<|endoftext|> Generally construction work proceeded smoothly and from an engineering point of view there were few setbacks. However, one did occur in the early stages of construction. In March 1934 there was a violent storm bringing 130 mm ( 5 @.@ 12 in ) of rain in less than two days. As a result, the river rose rapidly which flooded the dam foundation workings. <unk> had to be installed and work resumed three days later. 
<|endoftext|> The dam was completed in September 1940. When built it was the longest concrete gravity dam in Australia, and also the second highest after the <unk> Dam in New South Wales. As of 1997 of the 90 large concrete and masonry gravity dams in Australia the Canning Dam is still the fifth highest and the sixth longest. It is the largest concrete dam in Western Australia in terms of length of crest and volume of concrete. 
<|endoftext|> The final cost of the dam was significantly less than had been originally budgeted for, and the work was completed on schedule to a date that was calculated seven years previously.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Recently the Canning Dam has been subjected to considerable <unk> of the upper parts of the dam and upper gallery. Investigations have shown that <unk> was due to strong AAR ( alkali aggregate reactivity ) in the concrete. AAR results in swelling of the concrete, which may cause secondary <unk> stresses, localised map cracks, and, ultimately structural cracks. In addition, the concrete tensile strength and elasticity significantly decreases. Many old concrete dams are known to suffer from AAR, including <unk> Dam in Tennessee and <unk> <unk> dam in Italy among others.

Class I stones are those thought to date to the period up to the seventh century and are the most numerous group. The stones are largely <unk> and include <unk> symbols of animals such as fish and the Pictish beast, everyday objects such as mirrors, <unk> and tuning forks and abstract symbols defined by names including V @-@ rod, double disc and Z @-@ rod. They are found between from the Firth of Forth to Shetland. The greatest concentrations are in Sutherland, around modern Inverness and Aberdeen. Good examples include the <unk> ( Sutherland ) and <unk> stones ( Angus ). 
<|endoftext|> Class II stones are carefully shaped slabs dating after the arrival of Christianity in the eighth and ninth centuries, with a cross on one face and a wide range of symbols on the reverse. In smaller numbers than Class I stones, they predominate in southern <unk>, in Perth, Angus and Fife. Good examples include <unk> 2, which contains a finely executed Celtic cross on the main face with two opposing male figures, a <unk>, cauldron, deer head and a triple disc symbol and <unk>, Angus, which shows a high @-@ <unk> Pictish boat with oarsmen and a figure facing forward in the prow. Class III stones are thought to overlap <unk> with Class II stones. Most are elaborately shaped and <unk> cross @-@ slabs, some with <unk> scenes, but lacking <unk> Pictish symbols.

This included extensive evidence for the production of high status jewellery and moulds from the seventh century that indicate the production of pieces similar to the <unk> brooch, found in Ayrshire, which may have been made in Dál Riata, but with elements that suggest Irish origins. These and other finds, including a trumpet spiral decorated hanging bowl disc and a stamped animal decoration ( or <unk> ), perhaps from a bucket or drinking horn, indicate the ways in which Dál Riata was one of the locations where the Insular style was developed.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The newly constructed Minnesota and Northwestern Railroad across northern Illinois utilized trackage rights on the Illinois Central Railroad between <unk>, Iowa and Stockton, Illinois in 1886 before construction on its own line through the isolated wilderness could commence. Engineers quickly realized that a tunnel would need to be constructed in order to traverse the rugged landscape. The <unk>, Winston and Company ( for which the tunnel would be named ) and more than 350 laborers worked by hand, digging through the <unk> and unstable shale for nine months starting in the spring of 1887. The work was <unk> and dangerous, and at least one worker, a thirty @-@ two @-@ year @-@ old Finnish immigrant named John Hill, was killed. When complete, the total cost of the tunnel, $ 600 @,@ 000, had exceeded expectations. 
<|endoftext|> The tunnel proved to be a constant nuisance to the Chicago Great Western and its predecessors. Almost immediately, railroad engineers realized that the unstable nature of shale through which the tunnel was bored, ground water seepage, and the isolated location of the tunnel meant repairs would be frequent and costly. The tunnel was originally <unk> by wooden beams when it opened to rail traffic in January 1888, but these eventually proved inadequate, to be replaced in 1902 by brick and reinforced concrete. Constant deterioration of the supports meant large @-@ scale reconstruction of the tunnel would be needed again in 1912, 1918, 1944 and 1947. 
<|endoftext|> The bore was also improperly <unk> at first. A shaft sunk into the top of the tunnel failed to provide enough fresh air, and the crews of the steam engines would often complain of the intense heat and smoke due to the poor air circulation. <unk> solutions failed to work, and by 1912 the railroad was forced to install a huge fan, powered by a 310 horsepower ( 230 kW ) diesel motor and staffed by operators day and night, to <unk> the tunnel. The <unk>, constructed by 1916, was abandoned by the CGW with the acquisition of diesel <unk> by 1947. 
<|endoftext|> When the Chicago Great Western was <unk> during World War I, a contingent of Illinois National Guardsmen were assigned to protect the tunnel. 
<|endoftext|> The operating <unk> of the tunnel, not to mention the millions of dollars the CGW spent to keep it open, forced the railroad's management to consider many schemes to rid themselves of the burden. In 1909, 1951 and again in 1964 ( the same year the North Western and Great Western announced their intentions to merge ) the CGW sought engineering proposals to <unk> their trackage around the bore, to daylight the tunnel, or to completely rebuild and improve it. To the often cash @-@ <unk> Great Western, however, all these plans proved far too expensive. 
<|endoftext|> In the end, the 1968 merger with the Chicago and North Western ( C & NW ) sealed the Winston Tunnel's fate. The Great Western's main line through northern Illinois closely paralleled the North Western's own line, but through less densely populated and less commercially active areas. The steep grades of the line and the obvious financial burden of the Winston Tunnel also played a role in the decision to completely abandon the Great Western's trackage in the area. The C & NW operated its last train through the tunnel in 1971. <unk> pulled up the tracks the following year. Upon abandonment, the C & NW placed chain @-@ link fences over each bore of the tunnel to keep squatters and other <unk> out.

According to Bright, sales of all the Guitar Hero games released in 2009 totaled the number of sales of the 2008 title World Tour, demonstrating the <unk> of the marketing. Though Activision had originally planned on <unk> the offerings of the Guitar Hero series in 2010, the company <unk> their plans, reducing the number of offerings and focusing more on selling digital downloadable content for the series.

In an effort to discourage pad @-@ play and encourage leg spin bowling, a new variant of the lbw law was introduced, initially in Australia and the West Indies in the 1969 – 70 season, then in England for 1970. Under the re @-@ <unk> law, a batsman would be lbw if a ball destined to hit the stumps pitched in line with the wickets or " outside a batsman's off stump and in the opinion of the umpire he made no genuine attempt to play the ball with his bat. " This revision omitted the requirement that the impact should be in line with the wickets, but meant that any batsman playing a shot could not be out if the ball pitched outside off stump, in contrast to the 1935 law. The editor of Wisden believed the change encouraged batsmen to take more risks, and had produced more attractive cricket. However, the proportion of wickets falling lbw sharply declined, and concerns were expressed in Australia. The Australian authorities proposed a <unk> to the previous law. A batsman could once more be out to a ball that pitched outside off stump, but a provision was added that " if no stroke is offered to a ball pitching outside the off @-@ stump which in the opinion of the umpire would hit the stumps, but hits the batsman on any part of his person other than the hand, then the batsman is out, even if that part of the person hit is not in line between wicket and wicket. " The difference to the 1935 rule was that the batsman could now be out even if the ball struck outside the line of off @-@ stump. This wording was adopted throughout the world, although it was not yet part of the official Laws, from 1972 and the percentage of lbws sharply increased to beyond the levels preceding the 1970 change.

Replay analyses have shown that a greater proportion of balls striking an <unk> leg go on to hit the wicket than had once been expected. " He also suggests that umpires have been influenced by such evidence ; their greater understanding of which deliveries are likely to hit the stumps has made them more likely to rule out batsmen who are standing further away from the stumps. This trend is replicated in international cricket, where the increasing use of technology in reviewing decisions has altered the attitude of umpires. Spin bowlers in particular win far more appeals for lbw. However, the use of on @-@ field technology has proved controversial ; some critics regard it as more reliable than human judgement, while others believe that the umpire is better placed to make the decision. 
<|endoftext|> The International Cricket Council ( ICC ), responsible for running the game worldwide, conducted a trial in 2002 where lbw appeals could be referred to a match official, the third umpire, to review on television replays. The third umpire could only use technology to determine where the ball had pitched and if the batsman hit the ball with his bat. The ICC judged the experiment unsuccessful and did not pursue it. More trials followed in 2006, although ball @-@ tracking technology remained unavailable to match officials. After a further series of trials, in 2009 the <unk> Decision Review System ( DRS ) was brought into international cricket where teams could refer the on @-@ field decisions of umpires to a third umpire who had access to television replays and technology such as ball tracking. According to the ICC's general manager, Dave Richardson, DRS increased the frequency with which umpires awarded lbw decisions. In a 2012 interview, he said : " <unk> may have realised that if they give someone out and DRS

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = Réunion ibis = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The Réunion ibis or Réunion sacred ibis ( <unk> solitarius ) is an extinct species of ibis that was endemic to the volcanic island of Réunion in the Indian Ocean. The first subfossil remains were found in 1974, and the ibis was first scientifically described in 1987. Its closest relatives are the <unk> sacred ibis, the African sacred ibis, and the straw @-@ necked ibis. 
<|endoftext|> <unk>'accounts from the 17th and 18th centuries described a white bird that flew with difficulty, and it was subsequently referred to as the Réunion solitaire. In the mid 19th century, the old travellers'accounts were incorrectly assumed to refer to white relatives of the dodo, due to one account specifically mentioning dodos on the island, and because 17th @-@ century paintings of white dodos had recently surfaced. However, no fossils <unk> to dodo @-@ like birds were ever found on Réunion, and it was later questioned whether the paintings had anything to do with the island. Other identities were suggested as well, based only on speculation. In the late 20th century, the discovery of a subfossil ibis led to the idea that the old accounts actually referred to an ibis species instead. The idea that the solitaire and the subfossil ibis are identical has only met with limited dissent, and is now widely accepted. 
<|endoftext|> Combined, the old descriptions and subfossils show that the Réunion ibis was mainly white, with this colour merging into yellow and grey. The wing tips and plumes of ostrich @-@ like feathers on its rear were black. The neck and legs were long, the beak was relatively straight and short for an ibis. It was more robust in build than its extant relatives, but was otherwise quite similar to them. <unk> wing @-@ bones indicate it had reduced flight capabilities, a feature perhaps linked to seasonal <unk>. The diet of the Réunion ibis was worms and other items <unk> from soil. It preferred solitude ( hence the name " solitaire " ). In the 17th century, it lived in mountainous areas, but it may have been confined to these remote heights by heavy hunting by humans and predation by introduced animals in the more accessible areas of the island. <unk> to Réunion praised its flavour, and therefore sought after its flesh. These factors are believed to have driven the Réunion ibis to extinction by the early 18th century. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Taxonomy = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The taxonomic history of the Réunion ibis is <unk> and complex, due to the ambiguous and <unk> evidence that was available to scientists until recently. The supposed " white dodo " of Réunion is now believed to have been an erroneous <unk> based on the few contemporary reports which described the Réunion ibis, combined with paintings of white dodos from Mauritius by the Dutch painters Pieter Withoos and Pieter Holsteyn II ( and derivatives ) from the 17th century that surfaced in the 19th century. 
<|endoftext|> The English Chief Officer John <unk> was the first to mention a specifically white bird on Réunion, in 1625. The French occupied the island from 1646 and onwards, and referred to this bird as the " solitaire ". M. <unk> of the French East Indies Company described the solitaire in <unk>, explaining the reason for its name :

<|endoftext|> standing unfair to strike ". Cricket bats were modified to become <unk> over the following years, allowing batsmen to stand closer to the wickets. Subsequently, some players deliberately began to obstruct the ball from hitting the wickets. Such tactics were criticised by writers and a revision of the laws in 1774 ruled that the batsman was out if he deliberately stopped the ball from hitting the wicket with his leg. However, critics noted that the umpires were left the difficult task of interpreting the intentions of batsmen. The 1788 version of the laws no longer required the umpires to take account of the batsman's intent ; now a batsman was lbw if he stopped a ball that " pitch [ ed ] straight ". Further clarification of the law came in 1823, when a condition was added that " the ball must be delivered in a straight line to the wicket ". The ambiguity of the wording was highlighted when two prominent umpires disagreed over whether the ball had to travel in a straight line from the bowler to the wicket, or between the wickets at either end of the pitch. In 1839 the MCC, by then responsible for drafting the Laws of Cricket, endorsed the latter interpretation and ruled the batsman out lbw if the ball pitched in between the wickets and would have hit the stumps. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Controversy and attempted reform = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In essence, the lbw law remained the same between 1839 and 1937, despite several campaigns to have it changed. An 1863 proposal to allow a batsman to be lbw if the ball hit his body at any point between the wickets, regardless of where the ball pitched or whether it would hit the wicket at all, came to nothing. There were few complaints until the proportion of lbw dismissals in county cricket began to increase during the 1880s. Until then, batsmen used their pads only to protect their legs ; their use for any other purposes was considered <unk>, and some amateur cricketers did not wear them at all. As cricket became more organised and competitive, some batsmen began to use their pads as a second line of defence : they lined them up with the ball so that if they missed with the bat, the ball struck the pad instead of the wicket. Some players took this further ; if the delivery was not an easy one from which to score runs, they attempted no shot and allowed the ball to bounce safely off their pads. Arthur Shrewsbury was the first prominent player to use such methods, and others followed. Criticism of this practice was heightened by the increased quality and reliability of cricket pitches, which made batting easier, led to higher scores and created a perceived imbalance in the game. 
<|endoftext|> Several proposals were made to prevent pad @-@ play. At a meeting of representatives of the main county cricket clubs in 1888, one representative expressed the opinion that a " batsman who defended his wicket with his body instead of with his bat should be punished ". The representatives supported a motion to alter the law to state that the batsman would be out if he stopped a ball that would have hit the wicket ; in contrast to the existing wording, this took no account of where the ball pitched relative to the wickets. Further proposals included one in which the intent of the batsman was taken into account, but no laws were changed and the MCC merely issued a condemnation of the practice of using pads for defence. This reduced pad @-@ play for a short time, but when it increased again, a second <unk> by the MCC had little effect. 
<|endoftext|> Further discussion on altering the law took place in 1899, when several prominent cricketers supported an amendment similar to the 1888 proposal : the batsman would be out if the ball would have hit the wicket, where it pitched was irrelevant. At a Special General Meeting of the MCC in 1902, Alfred <unk> formally proposed this amendment ; the motion was supported by 259 votes to 188, but failed to secure the two @-@ thirds majority required to change the laws. A. G. Steel was the principal opponent of the change, as he believed it would make the task of the umpires too difficult, but he later regretted his stance. <unk>'s brother, Robert, supported the alteration and campaigned for the rest of his life to have the lbw law altered. As evidence that pad @-@ play was increasing and needed to be curtailed, he cited the growing number of wickets which were falling lbw : the proportion rose from 2 % of dismissals in 1870 to 6 % in 1890, and 12 % in 1923. In 1902, the proposed new law was tried in the Minor Counties Championship, but deemed a failure. An increase in the size of the stumps was one of several other rejected proposals at this time to reduce the dominance of batsmen over bowlers.

<|endoftext|> for expensive defence preparations with it. For many years nothing substantive came about from debate on defence of the colony. Over time there formed a consensus favouring Semaphore for fixed defences or fortification ; a strategy also argued by the government established Hart Commission in 1858. Raiders were seen as unlikely to force the <unk> of the Port River but instead were expected to stand off Semaphore, shell the port and use their guns to support landings. The Hart Report recommended building of <unk> towers at Semaphore and Glenelg, the first report to recommend permanent fortification at Semaphore, though none were built mainly due to the cost. 
<|endoftext|> The volunteer military force was revived in 1859, with new and modern arms for the infantry, cavalry and artillery. Though there was a few years of enthusiasm and a restructuring in 1866, by 1870 the force was virtually disbanded. In that year also, British troops were withdrawn from the other Australian colonies ; none were by then stationed in South Australia. With no definitive defence policy, in 1864 the government had sought advice from Captain <unk> of HMS Falcon and Commodore Sir William Wiseman commander of the Australian station ; both visiting British naval officers. They both recommended fixed fortifications for the coast supported by gunboats. Sir Wiseman's report particularly recommended construction of forts at Semaphore, Port Creek's entrance and one midway between. In 1864 a story circulated, supported by press speculation, that there was a danger of the Russian fleet attacking Melbourne should Russia and Britain find themselves at war. The South Australian Register produced an editorial decrying the states lack of defences. Within days £ 20 @,@ 000 ( A $ 4 @.@ 14 million in 2005 ) was provided by the government for defence, an amount then seen as insufficient for significant preparation. The danger passed without any lasting defence action except the government's in @-@ principle adoption of Sir Wiseman's recommendations. To <unk> costs only the Semaphore fort was to be built initially, as it was considered the most critical. Site preparation begun and two 9 @-@ inch ( 230 mm ) guns were purchased, but escalating cost estimates caused the plan to be abandoned by 1868. 
<|endoftext|> During the early 1870s South Australia's defence was solely dependent on the volunteer military, and a few artillery pieces purchased during earlier war <unk>. British troops had been withdrawn from the Australian colonies in 1870, leaving the state dependent on its own military resources. In a report to the government in 1866, Colonel <unk> and Major Peter Scratchley recommended establishment of a permanent military force. In 1876 the South Australian government, along with those from New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland requested from the War Office that Major General Sir William Jervois, a noted coastal fortification expert, be appointed to advise on defence needs. He arrived in Sydney in mid @-@ 1877 with then Lieutenant Colonel Scratchley. The 1877 report, delivered after he became South Australian Governor, called for three batteries, at Largs Bay, Semaphore and Glenelg, connected by a military road and supported by field gun emplacements, naval elements and mobile forces. He determined that South Australia's most probable defence risk was an attack by up to two ships rather than a larger force, and this formed the basis of the final fortification design. His report called for Military Road to be extended to Marino, an electro @-@ contact torpedo station be established on Torrens Island and that a gun boat be provided. In November 1878 the government passed the Military Forces Act, which provided for the raising of a permanent military force and reserve. Two volunteer reserve rifle companies were formed in 1878 and a permanent artillery unit in 1882. 
<|endoftext|> At this time Semaphore, with its jetty built in 1860, was the state's main entry point for passengers and mail. It had a signal station ( built 1872 ) and a time ball tower ( built 1875 ). Semaphore remained of great maritime significance for the state until the 1880s. When the decision was made to build the fort, in 1878, the state's population had reached approximately 250 @,@ 000. Settlement extended beyond Port Augusta, though Adelaide remained the dominant feature in the economy partly due to the layout of the rail network. At this point Adelaide had a population of over 30 @,@ 000. Port Adelaide was the main port for South Australia, with over 1000 ships visiting each year, and a local population of over 2 @,@ 500.

Rising in the Rocky Mountains of western Montana, the Missouri flows east and south for 2 @,@ 341 miles ( 3 @,@ 767 km ) before entering the Mississippi River north of St. Louis, Missouri. The river takes drainage from a sparsely populated, semi @-@ arid watershed of more than half a million square miles ( 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 km2 ), which includes parts of ten U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. When combined with the lower Mississippi River, it forms the world's fourth longest river system. 
<|endoftext|> For over 12 @,@ 000 years, people have depended on the Missouri River and its tributaries as a source of sustenance and transportation. More than ten major groups of Native Americans populated the watershed, most leading a nomadic lifestyle and dependent on enormous buffalo herds that once roamed through the Great Plains. The first Europeans encountered the river in the late seventeenth century, and the region passed through Spanish and French hands before finally becoming part of the United States through the Louisiana Purchase. The Missouri was long believed to be part of the Northwest Passage – a water route from the Atlantic to the Pacific – but when Lewis and Clark became the first to travel the river's entire length, they confirmed the mythical pathway to be no more than a legend. 
<|endoftext|> The Missouri River was one of the main routes for the westward expansion of the United States during the 19th century. The growth of the fur trade in the early 1800s laid much of the <unk> as trappers explored the region and blazed trails. Pioneers headed west en <unk> beginning in the 1830s, first by covered wagon, then by the growing numbers of steamboats entering service on the river. Former Native American lands in the watershed were taken over by settlers, leading to some of the most longstanding and violent wars against indigenous peoples in American history.

It took another 13 years for it to be dedicated on December 6, 1947. One month before the dedication of the park, the former editor of The Miami Herald and freelance writer Marjory Stoneman Douglas published her first book, The Everglades : River of Grass. After researching the region for five years, she described the history and ecology of the south of Florida in great detail, characterizing the Everglades as a river instead of a stagnant swamp. Douglas later wrote, " My colleague Art Marshall said that with [ the words " River of Grass " ] I changed everybody's knowledge and educated the world as to what the Everglades meant ".

The C & SF used four methods in flood management : levees, water storage areas, canal improvements, and large pumps to assist gravity. Between 1952 and 1954 in cooperation with the state of Florida it built a levee 100 miles ( 160 km ) long between the eastern Everglades and suburbs from Palm Beach to <unk>, and blocked the flow of water into populated areas. Between 1954 and 1963 it divided the Everglades into basins. In the northern Everglades were Water Conservation Areas ( WCAs ), and the Everglades Agricultural Area ( EAA ) bordering to the south of Lake Okeechobee. In the southern Everglades was Everglades National Park. <unk> and pumping stations bordered each WCA, which released water in drier times and removed it and pumped it to the ocean or Gulf of Mexico in times of flood.

However, an early report by the project reflected local attitudes about the Everglades as a priority to people in nearby developed areas : " The aesthetic appeal of the Park can never be as strong as the demands of home and livelihood.

It is possible that Hairan of the 251 inscription is not the same as Herodianus of the 263, but this is contested by Hartmann who conclude that the reason for the difference in the spelling is due to the language used in the inscription ( Herodianus being the Greek version ), meaning that Odaenathus'eldest son and co @-@ king is Hairan Herodianus.

Hairan I was apparently elevated to co @-@ lordship status by his father. Although the written evidence for Odaenathus lordship dates to 251, it is possible that he acquired the title as early as the 240s ; following the death of Roman emperor Gordian III in <unk> during a campaign against Persia, the Palmyrenes might have elected Odaenathus to defend the city. 
<|endoftext|> Odaenathus was described as Roman senator in the undated tomb inscription and Hairan I was mentioned with the same title in the 251 inscription. <unk> opinions vary on the exact date of Odaenathus'elevation to the position ; <unk> and Jean <unk> maintain that the <unk> rank predates the Ras elevation. <unk> Hartmann concludes that Odaenathus first became a Ras in the 240s then a senator in 250.

<|endoftext|> Gods were combined with each other as easily as they were divided. A god could be called the ba of another, or two or more deities could be joined into one god with a combined name and iconography. Local gods were linked with greater ones, and deities with similar functions were combined.

On rare occasion, even deities of different sexes were joined in this way, producing combinations like Osiris @-@ <unk> and <unk> @-@ <unk>. This linking of deities is called syncretism. Unlike other situations for which this term is used, the Egyptian practice was not meant to fuse competing belief systems, although foreign deities could be syncretized with native ones. Instead, syncretism acknowledged the overlap between their roles, and extended the sphere of influence for each of them. <unk> combinations were not permanent ; a god who was involved in one combination continued to appear separately and to form new combinations with other deities. But closely connected deities did sometimes merge.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In the reign of Akhenaten ( c. <unk> – 1336 BC ) in the mid @-@ New Kingdom, a single solar deity, the Aten, became the sole focus of the state religion. Akhenaten ceased to fund the temples of other deities and erased the gods'names and images on monuments, targeting Amun in particular. This new religious system, sometimes called Atenism, differed dramatically from the polytheistic worship of many gods in all other periods. Whereas, in earlier times, newly important gods were integrated into existing religious beliefs, Atenism insisted on a single understanding of the divine that excluded the traditional multiplicity of perspectives. Yet Atenism may not have been full monotheism, which totally excludes belief in other deities. There is evidence suggesting that the general populace was still allowed to worship other gods in private. The picture is further complicated by Atenism's apparent tolerance for some other deities, like Shu. For these reasons, the Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat suggested that Akhenaten may have been <unk>, <unk> a single deity while acknowledging the existence of others. In any case, Atenism's aberrant theology did not take root among the Egyptian populace, and Akhenaten's successors returned to traditional beliefs. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Unity of the divine in traditional religion = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Scholars have long debated whether traditional Egyptian religion ever asserted that the multiple gods were, on a deeper level, unified. Reasons for this debate include the practice of syncretism, which might suggest that all the separate gods could ultimately merge into one, and the tendency of Egyptian texts to credit a particular god with power that surpasses all other deities. Another point of contention is the appearance of the word " god " in wisdom literature, where the term does not refer to a specific deity or group of deities. In the early 20th century, for instance, E. A. Wallis <unk> believed that Egyptian commoners were polytheistic, but knowledge of the true monotheistic nature of the religion was reserved for the elite, who wrote the wisdom literature. His contemporary James Henry <unk> thought Egyptian religion was instead <unk>, with the power of the sun god present in all other gods, while Hermann <unk> argued that Egyptian civilization had been originally monotheistic and became polytheistic in the course of its history. 
<|endoftext|> In 1971, Erik Hornung published a study <unk> these views. He points out that in any given period many deities, even minor ones, were described as superior to all others. He also argues that the unspecified " god " in the wisdom texts is a generic term for whichever deity the reader chooses to <unk>. Although the combinations, manifestations, and iconographies of each god were constantly shifting, they were always restricted to a finite number of forms, never becoming fully interchangeable in a monotheistic or <unk> way.

<|endoftext|> The tone of the poem rejects the optimistic pursuit of pleasure found within Keats's earlier poems and, rather, explores the themes of nature, <unk> and mortality, the latter being particularly personal to Keats. 
<|endoftext|> The nightingale described within the poem experiences a type of death but does not actually die. Instead, the <unk> is capable of living through its song, which is a fate that humans cannot expect. The poem ends with an acceptance that pleasure cannot last and that death is an inevitable part of life. In the poem, Keats imagines the loss of the physical world and sees himself dead — as a " sod " over which the nightingale sings. The contrast between the immortal nightingale and mortal man sitting in his garden, is made all the more acute by an effort of the imagination. The presence of weather is noticeable in the poem, as spring came early in 1819, bringing <unk> all over the heath. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Background = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Of Keats's six major odes of 1819, " Ode to Psyche ", was probably written first and " To Autumn " written last. <unk> between these two, he wrote " Ode to a Nightingale ". It is possible that " Ode to a Nightingale " was written between 26 April and 18 May 1819, based on weather conditions and similarities between images in the poem and those in a letter sent to Fanny Keats on May Day. The poem was composed at the Hampstead house Keats shared with Brown, possibly while sitting beneath a plum tree in the garden. According to Keats'friend Brown, Keats finished the ode in just one morning : " In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song ; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast @-@ table to the grass @-@ plot under a plum @-@ tree, where he sat for two or three hours. When he came into the house, I perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand, and these he was quietly <unk> behind the books. On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feelings on the song of the nightingale. " Brown's account is personal, as he claimed the poem was directly influenced by his house and preserved by his own doing. However, Keats relied on both his own imagination and other literature as sources for his depiction of the nightingale. 
<|endoftext|> The exact date of " Ode to a Nightingale ", as well as " Ode on Indolence ", " Ode on Melancholy ", and " Ode on a Grecian Urn ", is unknown, as Keats dated all as'May 1819 '. However, he worked on the four poems together, and there is a unity in both their stanza forms and their themes. The exact order the poems were written in is also unknown, but they form a sequence within their structures. While Keats was writing " Ode on a Grecian Urn " and the other poems, Brown transcribed copies of the poems and submitted them to Richard Woodhouse. During this time, Benjamin <unk>, Keats'friend, was given a copy of " Ode to a Nightingale ", and he shared the poem with the editor of the Annals of the Fine Arts, James <unk>. <unk> paid Keats a small sum of money, and the poem was published in the July issue.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> " Ode to a Nightingale " was probably the first of the middle set of four odes that Keats wrote following " Ode to Psyche ", according to Brown. There is further evidence of this in the structure of the poems because Keats combines two different types of lyrical poetry in an experimental way : the <unk> hymn and the lyric of questioning voice that responds to the <unk> hymn. This combination of structures is similar to that in " Ode on a Grecian Urn ". In both poems the dual form creates a sort of dramatic element within the poem. The stanza forms of the poem is a combination of elements from <unk> <unk> and Shakespearean <unk>.

" Rachel and Joey's romantic storyline was conceived because the writers wanted to delay Ross and Rachel's reunion further. Crane felt that pairing Rachel and Joey during season ten " was for the greater good " because " It was inappropriate. " However, the cast initially protested the idea, fearing that Rachel, Joey, and Ross would ultimately become <unk> characters and audiences would either " resent Joey for going after a pregnant woman, or resent Rachel for rejecting him, or resent Ross for standing between the two of them. " Meanwhile, the writers also approached the concept of Rachel's pregnancy and baby tentatively, worrying about how they would include it in the show because they did not want Friends " to become a show about a baby " while " On the other hand, we don 't want to pretend that there isn 't one. " According to Robert Bianco of USA Today, the critical success and popularity of Rachel's pregnancy is ultimately responsible for " propel [ ling ] the show to the top of the ratings ". When it finally came time to write the series finale, " The only thing [ Crane and Kauffman ] absolutely knew from very early on was that we had to get Ross and Rachel together, " deciding, " We had <unk> the audience around for 10 years with their'will they or won ’ t they,'and we didn ’ t see any advantage in frustrating them " any longer.

A. sp. 2, as it is also known, differs from A. fragilis in several anatomical details including a jugal or <unk> with a straight lower margin, and is also found only in the Salt <unk> Member of the Morrison Formation, with A. fragilis only present in the higher <unk> Basin Member. A. maximus was coined by David K. Smith for Chure's Saurophaganax maximus, a taxon created by Chure in 1995 for giant <unk> remains from the Morrison of Oklahoma. These remains had been known as <unk>, but that name was already in use, leading Chure to propose a substitute. Smith, in his 1998 analysis of variation, concluded that S. maximus was not different enough from Allosaurus to be a separate genus, but did warrant its own species, A. maximus. This <unk> was rejected in the most recent review of basal <unk>.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The perception that there were two common Allosaurus species in the Morrison Formation was popularized in Gregory S. Paul's 1988 book Predatory Dinosaurs of the World. Paul proposed that A. fragilis had tall pointed horns and a slender build compared to a postulated second species A. atrox, and was not a different gender due to rarity. Allosaurus atrox was originally named by Marsh in 1878 as the type species of its own genus, Creosaurus, and is based on YPM 1890, an assortment of bones including a couple of pieces of the skull, portions of nine tail vertebrae, two hip vertebrae, an <unk>, and ankle and foot bones. Although the idea of two common Morrison allosaur species has had support in semi @-@ technical and popular works, it has generally been rejected in the technical literature. 
<|endoftext|> David K. Smith, examining Allosaurus fossils by quarry, found that the Cleveland Lloyd Dinosaur <unk> ( Utah ) specimens are generally smaller than those from <unk> Bluff ( Wyoming ) or <unk> Young University's Dry Mesa <unk> ( Colorado ), but the shapes of the bones themselves did not vary between the sites. A later study by Smith incorporating Garden Park ( Colorado ) and Dinosaur National Monument ( Utah ) specimens found no justification for multiple species based on skeletal variation ; skull variation was most common and was <unk>, suggesting individual variation was responsible. Further work on size @-@ related variation again found no consistent differences, although the Dry Mesa material tended to clump together on the basis of the <unk>, an ankle bone. Kenneth Carpenter, using skull elements from the Cleveland Lloyd site, found wide variation between individuals, calling into question previous species @-@ level distinctions based such features as the shape of the horns, and the proposed differentiation of " A. jimmadseni " based on the shape of the jugal.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> A number of species assigned to Allosaurus are no longer recognized as valid, for one reason or another. Species " A. <unk> ", seen in <unk>, 1887, and <unk>, 1912, is a typographical error for A. fragilis. Marsh's A. ferox ( 1896 ; not to be confused with his 1884 Labrosaurus ferox, also part of Allosaurus taxonomy ) was coined for a partial skull in a footnote, and has been recognized as a specimen of A fragilis. A. lucaris, another Marsh name, was given to a partial skeleton in 1878. He later decided it warranted its own genus, Labrosaurus, but this has not been accepted, and A. lucaris is also regarded as another specimen of A. fragilis. Allosaurus lucaris, is known mostly from vertebrae, sharing characters with Allosaurus. Paul and Carpenter stated that the type specimen of this species, YPM 1931, was from a younger age than Allosaurus, and might represent a different genus. However, they found that the specimen was <unk>, and thus A. lucaris was a nomen dubium. " A. <unk> ", an informally described species coined by Pickering in 1996, is a <unk> of the A. atrox versus A. fragilis debate using a better specimen to represent the A. atrox form, and has not been recognized. 
<|endoftext|> Several species coined in genera other than Allosaurus are also now thought to be synonymous with A. fragilis. Labrosaurus ferox was named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row at the tip of the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down.

The Imperial Japanese Army felt a smaller pistol of domestic design that could accommodate the standard 8 × <unk> Nambu cartridge was needed to substitute the larger, heavier, and only official military pistol, the Type 14 Nambu. The demand for officer's <unk> had increased as a result of Japan's invasion of <unk> during the Second <unk> @-@ Japanese War.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Although many popular commentators, including psychologist Margaret Singer, speculate that Applewhite brainwashed his followers, many academics have rejected the " brainwashing " label as an <unk> that does not express the nuances of the process by which the followers were influenced. Lalich speculates that they were willing to follow Applewhite in suicide because they had become totally dependent upon him, and hence were poorly suited for life in his absence. Davis attributes Applewhite's success in convincing his followers to commit suicide to two factors : he isolated them socially and cultivated an attitude of complete religious obedience in them. Applewhite's students had made a long @-@ term commitment to him, and Balch and Taylor <unk> that this is why his interpretations of events appeared coherent to them. Most of the dead had been members for about 20 years, although there were a few recent converts. 
<|endoftext|> Lewis argues that Applewhite effectively controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing that members of the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he <unk> controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide because they saw it as a way to demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite. 
<|endoftext|> Urban writes that Applewhite's life displays " the intense <unk> and alienation shared by many individuals lost in late twentieth @-@ century capitalist society ". He notes that Applewhite's condemnations of contemporary culture bear similarities to those of Jean <unk> at times, particularly their shared <unk> views. Urban posits that Applewhite found no way other than suicide to escape the society that surrounded him and states that death offered him a way to escape its " endless circle of seduction and consumption ". 
<|endoftext|> While covering the suicides, several media outlets focused on Applewhite's sexuality ; the New York Post dubbed him " the Gay Guru ". Gay rights activist Troy Perry argued that Applewhite's repression, and society's rejection, of same @-@ sex relationships ultimately led to his suicide. This idea has failed to gain support among academics. Zeller argues that Applewhite's sexuality was not the primary driving force behind his asceticism, which he believes resulted from a variety of factors, though he grants sexuality a role. 
<|endoftext|> Lalich states that Applewhite fit " the traditional view of a charismatic leader ", and Evan Thomas deems him a " master <unk> ". Lifton compares Applewhite to <unk> <unk>, the founder of <unk> <unk>, describing him as " equally controlling, his paranoia and <unk> gentler yet ever present ".

He also found that the way in which he listened to music had changed after producing Illinois :

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The type specimen of Banksia violacea was collected by the West Australian botanist Charles Gardner on 14 December 1926 in the vicinity of Lake Grace. The following year, he published a description of the species in Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Western Australia. He placed it in section Oncostylis of <unk>'s taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, giving it the specific epithet violacea in reference to the violet flowers. Thus the full name of the species, with author citation, is Banksia violacea <unk> The species has been considered a variety of B. sphaerocarpa ( Fox Banksia ) ; this view was published by William <unk> in his 1954 How to know Western Australian <unk>. He considered B. violacea to be a variety of B. sphaerocarpa with violet flowers. This description was an invalid publication, however, and a nomen nudum. In 1981 Alex George declared Banksia sphaerocarpa var. violacea <unk> a <unk> synonym of B. violacea. 
<|endoftext|> In George's 1981 arrangement, B. violacea was placed in subgenus Banksia because its <unk> is a typical Banksia " flower spike " ; section Oncostylis because of its hooked styles ; and series Abietinae because its <unk> is roughly spherical. It was placed in taxonomic sequence between B. incana ( <unk> Banksia ) and B. <unk> ( <unk>'s Banksia ). 
<|endoftext|> In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a cladistic analysis of morphological characters of Banksia. They retained George's <unk> and many of his series, but discarded his sections. B. ser. Abietinae was found to be very nearly monophyletic and so it was retained. It further resolved into four <unk>, so Thiele and Ladiges split it into four subseries. B. violacea appeared in the last of these : 
<|endoftext|> This clade became the basis of B. subseries <unk>, which Thiele defined as containing those taxa with very long and slender styles, smoothly convex perianth limbs without a <unk> ridge, and thickened margins. In accordance with their cladogram, their arrangement placed B. violacea first in taxonomic sequence, followed by B. laricina ( Rose @-@ <unk> Banksia ). However, Thiele and Ladiges'arrangement was not accepted by George, who, questioning the emphasis on <unk>, rejected most of their changes in his 1999 arrangement, restored B. series Abietinae to his broader 1981 definition, and abandoned all of Thiele and Ladiges'subseries. George commented that the species has no close relatives, being " loosely allied " to B. sphaerocarpa ( Fox Banksia ) and B. <unk> ( Swamp Fox Banksia ). Despite this, the sequence of the series was altered so that B. violacea fell between B. <unk> ( Burma Road Banksia ) and B. incana, and its placement in George's arrangement may be summarised as follows :

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> As the major defining characteristic of the eukaryotic cell, the nucleus'evolutionary origin has been the subject of much speculation. Four major hypotheses have been proposed to explain the existence of the nucleus, although none have yet earned widespread support. 
<|endoftext|> The first model known as the " <unk> model " proposes that a symbiotic relationship between the archaea and bacteria created the nucleus @-@ containing eukaryotic cell. ( <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> domain have no cell nucleus. ) It is hypothesized that the symbiosis originated when ancient archaea, similar to modern <unk> archaea, invaded and lived within bacteria similar to modern <unk>, eventually forming the early nucleus. This theory is analogous to the accepted theory for the origin of eukaryotic mitochondria and <unk>, which are thought to have developed from a similar <unk> relationship between proto @-@ eukaryotes and <unk> bacteria. The <unk> origin of the nucleus is supported by observations that archaea and <unk> have similar genes for certain proteins, including histones. Observations that <unk> are <unk>, can form multicellular complexes, and possess <unk> and G proteins similar to <unk>, support a bacterial origin for the eukaryotic cell. 
<|endoftext|> A second model proposes that proto @-@ eukaryotic cells evolved from bacteria without an <unk> stage. This model is based on the existence of modern <unk> bacteria that possess a nuclear structure with primitive pores and other <unk> membrane structures. A similar proposal states that a <unk> @-@ like cell, the <unk>, evolved first and <unk> archaea and bacteria to generate the nucleus and the eukaryotic cell. 
<|endoftext|> The most controversial model, known as viral <unk>, posits that the membrane @-@ bound nucleus, along with other eukaryotic features, originated from the infection of a <unk> by a virus. The suggestion is based on similarities between eukaryotes and viruses such as linear DNA strands, mRNA capping, and tight binding to proteins ( <unk> histones to viral <unk> ). One version of the proposal suggests that the nucleus evolved in concert with <unk> to form an early cellular " predator ". Another variant proposes that eukaryotes originated from early archaea infected by <unk>, on the basis of observed similarity between the DNA <unk> in modern <unk> and eukaryotes. It has been suggested that the unresolved question of the evolution of sex could be related to the viral <unk> hypothesis. 
<|endoftext|> A more recent proposal, the <unk> hypothesis, suggests that the nucleus instead originated from a single ancestral cell that evolved a second exterior cell membrane ; the interior membrane enclosing the original cell then became the nuclear membrane and evolved increasingly elaborate pore structures for passage of internally synthesized cellular components such as ribosomal subunits.

These newly formed stars emit jets of gas along their axis of rotation, which may reduce the angular momentum of the collapsing star and result in small patches of <unk> known as <unk> – <unk> objects. These jets, in combination with radiation from nearby massive stars, may help to drive away the surrounding cloud from which the star was formed. 
<|endoftext|> Early in their development, T Tauri stars follow the <unk> track — they contract and decrease in luminosity while remaining at roughly the same temperature. Less massive T Tauri stars follow this track to the main sequence, while more massive stars turn onto the <unk> track. 
<|endoftext|> Most stars are observed to be members of binary star systems, and the properties of those binaries are the result of the conditions in which they formed. A gas cloud must lose its angular momentum in order to collapse and form a star. The fragmentation of the cloud into multiple stars distributes some of that angular momentum. The primordial binaries transfer some angular momentum by gravitational interactions during close encounters with other stars in young stellar clusters. These interactions tend to split apart more widely separated ( soft ) binaries while causing hard binaries to become more tightly bound. This produces the separation of binaries into their two observed populations <unk>.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Stars spend about 90 % of their existence fusing hydrogen into helium in high @-@ temperature and high @-@ pressure reactions near the core. Such stars are said to be on the main sequence, and are called dwarf stars. Starting at zero @-@ age main sequence, the proportion of helium in a star's core will steadily increase, the rate of nuclear fusion at the core will slowly increase, as will the star's temperature and luminosity. The Sun, for example, is estimated to have increased in luminosity by about 40 % since it reached the main sequence 4 @.@ 6 billion ( 4 @.@ 6 × 109 ) years ago. 
<|endoftext|> Every star generates a stellar wind of particles that causes a continual outflow of gas into space. For most stars, the mass lost is negligible. The Sun loses 10 − 14 M ☉ every year, or about 0 @.@ 01 % of its total mass over its entire lifespan. However, very massive stars can lose 10 − 7 to 10 − 5 M ☉ each year, significantly affecting their evolution. Stars that begin with more than 50 M ☉ can lose over half their total mass while on the main sequence. 
<|endoftext|> The time a star spends on the main sequence depends primarily on the amount of fuel it has and the rate at which it fuses it. The Sun's is expected to live 10 billion ( <unk> ) years. Massive stars consume their fuel very rapidly and are short @-@ lived. Low mass stars consume their fuel very slowly. Stars less massive than 0 @.@ 25 M ☉, called red dwarfs, are able to fuse nearly all of their mass while stars of about 1 M ☉ can only fuse about 10 % of their mass. The combination of their slow fuel @-@ consumption and relatively large usable fuel supply allows low mass stars to last about one trillion ( 1012 ) years ; the most extreme of 0 @.@ 08 M ☉ ) will last for about 12 trillion years. Red dwarfs become <unk> and more luminous as they accumulate helium. When they eventually run out of hydrogen, they contract into a white dwarf and decline in temperature. However, since the lifespan of such stars is greater than the current age of the universe ( 13 @.@ 8 billion years ), no stars under about 0 @.@ 85 M ☉ are expected to have moved off the main sequence. 
<|endoftext|> Besides mass, the elements heavier than helium can play a significant role in the evolution of stars. Astronomers label all elements heavier than helium " metals ", and call the chemical concentration of these elements in a star, its metallicity. A star's metallicity can influence the time the star takes to burn its fuel, and controls the formation of its magnetic fields, which affects the strength of its stellar wind. Older, population II stars have substantially less metallicity than the younger, population I stars due to the composition of the molecular clouds from which they formed. Over time, such clouds become increasingly enriched in heavier elements as older stars die and shed portions of their atmospheres.

Shortly after 8 : 00 pm, 13 Platoon, supporting the 2 / 20th Infantry Battalion around the head of the Lim Chu Kang Road, was confronted by a large number of landing barges filled with Japanese assault troops. For almost six hours, the platoon, under Lieutenant Eric <unk>, fought a desperate action to repel the invaders. With four machine guns, as well as personal small arms and grenades, the platoon inflicted heavy casualties on the Japanese and sank several barges. Despite heavy casualties from Japanese mortar and machine gun fire, they kept fighting until early in the morning on 9 February when, threatened with being outflanked and low on ammunition — each gun had fired over 10 @,@ 000 rounds — and having had one gun knocked out, the platoon was forced to withdraw. Destroying their equipment as they went to prevent it from being captured, the platoon was forced to withdraw in contact, taking their wounded with them ; the action was later rewarded with a Military Cross for the platoon commander, who was badly wounded after taking over one of the machine guns after its crew had been wounded. 
<|endoftext|> Near the Sungei Murai ( Murai River ), 15 Platoon — under Lieutenant John Meiklejohn — had been stationed in support of a company from the 2 / 18th Infantry Battalion, in a thickly wooded area with low hills and many inlets. 15 Platoon established an enfilade formation near the shore, with its machine guns distributed in two sections on a north – south axis, facing a narrow peninsula, between the mouth of the Murai and a small inlet. According to the official history by Lionel Wigmore, after a Japanese landing party approached, the southern section under Meiklejohn " opened fire against six approaching barges, and kept on firing for two hours, despite retaliation by hand grenades, as the Japanese landed and crossed the neck of the peninsula ". As was the case elsewhere in the extremely wide sector assigned to the 22nd Brigade, many Japanese landing parties were able to outflank the thinly @-@ spread Australian positions. At risk of being cut off and with ammunition running low, Meiklejohn ordered the southern section to retreat. According to Wigmore : " Meiklejohn led his section along a jungle path where they came upon a party of Japanese resting. He shot some with his revolver, and another was knocked out with a swing from a [ machine gun ] tripod, but Meiklejohn lost his life in attempting to cover his section's withdrawal. " The northern section of 15 Platoon held its ground " until it was informed that a near @-@ by infantry platoon was almost surrounded, and about to withdraw ".

Despite not taking a strong interest in politics, Wheeler was described by his biographer as " a natural conservative " ; for instance, during his youth he was strongly critical of the <unk> and their cause of greater legal rights for women. Nevertheless, he was " usually happy to advance young women professionally ", something that may have been based largely on his sexual attraction toward them. He expressed little interest in his relatives ; in later life he saw no reason to have a social relationship with people purely on the basis of family ties.

In 1945 Mortimer Wheeler married his third wife, Margaret " Kim " Collingridge, although they became estranged in 1956 ; they never divorced as a result of her devout Catholicism. Meanwhile, Wheeler was well known for his conspicuous promiscuity, favouring young women for one night stands, many of whom were his students. He was further known for having casual sex in public places. This behaviour led to much emotional suffering among his various wives and <unk>, of which he was aware.

Highlighting his key role in encouraging interest in archaeology throughout British society, they stated that his " mastery of public archaeology was founded on his keen eye for value and a <unk>'s willingness to package and sell the past ". This was an issue about which Wheeler felt very strongly ; writing his obituary for the <unk> Memoirs of <unk> of the Royal Society, the English archaeologist Stuart Piggott noted that Wheeler placed " great importance to the archaeologist's obligation to the public, on whose support the prosecution of his subject ultimately depended.

<|endoftext|> Piggott believed that Wheeler's greatest impact was as " the great innovator in field techniques ", comparing him in this respect to Pitt @-@ Rivers.

<|endoftext|> Wheeler was well known for his publications on archaeological matters ; Carr stated that both Wheeler and his first wife emphasised " technical <unk> and a full presentation of materials unearthed, as well as a literary discussion of their meaning calculated to appeal to a larger audience.

The casting director had Durand read a page of dialogue for the new character Keamy ; Durand was offered the role in early October and he traveled to Honolulu in Hawaii — where Lost is filmed on location — by October 17, 2007. A former stand @-@ up comic and rapper from Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada, with the stage name " <unk> D ", Durand had seen only around six episodes of Lost by the time that he won the part. When he was shooting, he was confused by the story, later stating " I didn 't want to know anything or be attached to anybody. I'm glad I didn 't. But now that I'm on it, I 'll watch all of it.

<|endoftext|> Durand was never informed of his character's arc and only learned more of Keamy's importance to the plot as he received new scripts ; thus, he was thrilled when the role was expanded for his third appearance, in " The <unk> of Things to Come ", when he kills Alex and Durand compared his excitement to that of " a kid in a candy store. " He also stated that " you really don 't know what's going to happen in the next episode and you get the scripts pretty late, so it is pretty secretive and it's kind of exciting that way [ because ] you're really forced to get in the moment and say the words and play the guy ". Durand was initially met with negative reaction from fans on the street for this action and he defended his murderous character by arguing that it was actually more Ben's fault for failing to negotiate with Keamy ; later, fans warmed up to Keamy. Despite the antagonist's increasing popularity and fanbase, it became apparent to Durand that fans were hoping for Keamy's death in what promised to be a showdown in the season finale. Throughout his nine @-@ episode run, Keamy never receives an episode in which his backstory is developed through flashbacks and Durand holds this partially responsible for the negative reaction to his character, saying that the audience " [ has not ] really seen anything outside of Keamy's mission, so I think they definitely want him put down.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In their native habitat, all Amylostereum species have a minor importance as forest pests. The infestation through wood wasps does not assume greater dimensions and is, compared with other pests, almost insignificant. The infection rates are even lower during sexual reproduction via fruit bodies, as the wasps do not play a part in the process. Furthermore, the Amylostereum fungi are alone often incapable of <unk> healthy trees. They thus mostly act as <unk>. Pine <unk> in Australia, New Zealand, Africa and South America were shown to be susceptible to the Sirex <unk> ( Sirex noctilio ), which was introduced there and which is associated with A. areolatum. The wasp's <unk> secretion, its larvae and the fungus combine very effectively with each other and contribute to forest decline rates of up to 80 %. This is mainly owing to the poor water and nutrient supply of the trees, which can poorly reconcile the drought stress caused by infestation. S. noctilio was detected in North America in the 2000s ( decade ) ; in Canada alone, the total economic loss to the forestry industry caused by the Sirex – Amylostereum symbiosis could be as high as $ 254 million per year for the next 20 years. 
<|endoftext|> As a <unk>, cultures of the nematode <unk> <unk> have been used as biological control to protect trees since the 1980s.

Where S. noctilio larvae are present, the parasite <unk> and <unk> the eggs of female wasps, causing them to be infertile. These infertile females lay infected eggs into new trees and thus spread the nematode. This control method has proven to be relatively successful to combat the Sirex – Amylostereum complex.

Soon after his translation to York, Gerard began a long dispute with Anselm, claiming equal primacy with the Archbishop of Canterbury and refusing to make a profession of canonical obedience to Anselm, part of the long Canterbury – York dispute. At the 1102 Council of Westminster, Gerard reportedly kicked over the smaller chair provided for him as Archbishop of York, and refused to be seated until he was provided with one as large as Anselm's. He travelled to Rome in 1102 to receive his pallium from the pope, to whom he presented the king's side against Anselm in the controversy surrounding <unk>. The pope decided against the king, but Gerard and two other bishops reported that the pope had assured them that the various papal decrees against the lay investiture of bishops would not be enforced. Their claim was denied by Anselm's representatives and the pope, who excommunicated Gerard until he recanted.

James VI and I claimed that as monarch, he had a divine right to sit as a judge and interpret the common law as he saw fit. <unk> by Sir Edward Coke, the judiciary rejected this idea, stating that while the monarch was not subject to any individual, he was subject to the law. Until he had gained sufficient knowledge of the law, he had no right to interpret it ; Coke pointed out that such knowledge " demanded mastery of an artificial reason... which requires long study and experience, before that a man can attain to the <unk> of it ". Similarly, in the Case of <unk> in 1611, Coke held that the monarch could only exercise those prerogatives he already had, and not create new ones. 
<|endoftext|> With the Glorious Revolution, King James VII and II was replaced by Queen Mary II and her husband King William III. At the same time the Bill of Rights 1689 was drafted, which cemented the monarch's subservience to Parliament. It specifically limited the royal prerogative, with Article 1 holding that the " power of <unk> the laws or the execution of laws by regal authority without consent of Parliament is illegal ", and article 4 confirming that " <unk> money for or to the use of the Crown by <unk> of prerogative, without grant of Parliament, for longer time, or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal ".

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> One of the monarch's historic prerogatives was the dissolution of Parliament, which was " perhaps the most important residual prerogative exercised personally by the sovereign, and represents the greatest potential for controversy. " This prerogative was normally exercised at the request of Parliament and the prime minister, either at his or her discretion or following a motion of no confidence. Constitutional theorists have had differing views as to whether a unilateral dissolution of Parliament would be possible today ; Sir Ivor Jennings wrote that a dissolution involves " the <unk> of ministers ", and as such the monarch could not dissolve Parliament without <unk> consent ; " if ministers refuse to give such advice, she can do no more than dismiss them ". A. V. Dicey, however, believed that in certain extreme circumstances the monarch could dissolve Parliament single @-@ <unk>, on the condition that " an occasion has arisen on which there is fair reason to suppose that the opinion of the House is not the opinion of the electors... A dissolution is <unk>, or necessary, whenever the wishes of the legislature are, or may fairly be presumed to be, different from the wishes of the nation. " 
<|endoftext|> The monarch could force the dissolution of Parliament through a refusal of royal assent ; this would inevitably lead to a government resigning. By convention, the monarch always <unk> to bills ; the last time the royal assent was not given was in <unk> during the reign of Queen Anne. This does not mean that the right to refuse has died : George V believed he could veto the Third Irish Home Rule Bill ; Jennings writes that " it was assumed by the King throughout that he had not only the legal power but the constitutional right to refuse assent ". The royal prerogative to dissolve Parliament was <unk> by the Fixed @-@ term <unk> Act 2011. Section 6 ( 1 ) of the Act however specifically states that the monarch's power to <unk> Parliament is not affected by the Act. 
<|endoftext|> The appointment of the prime minister is also, theoretically, governed by the royal prerogative. Technically the monarch may appoint as prime minister anyone she wants to appoint, but in practice the appointee is always the person who commands a majority in the House of Commons. Usually, this is the leader of the political party that is returned to Parliament with a majority of seats after a general election. <unk> may result with a so @-@ called hung parliament, in which no party commands majority support, as last occurred in 2010. In this situation, constitutional convention is that the previous incumbent has the first right to form a coalition government and seek appointment. If the prime minister decides to retire in the middle of a parliamentary session, as Anthony Eden did in 1957, the monarch has no discretion. There is usually a " prime minister @-@ in @-@ waiting " who commands the support of the majority of the Commons ; he or she will near @-@ automatically be appointed.

<|endoftext|> At 00 : 00 on 5 December, two companies of the PPCLI crossed the Moro River, moving towards Villa Rogatti. Within an hour, vicious fighting had erupted throughout the town as the two companies of Canadian infantry struggled to break the German defensive lines. As B Company broke through the German defences, A Company attacked to the northeast, continuing to engage 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment ( 200. Panzergrenadier <unk> Regiment ) near Villa Rogatti. Although two Canadian infantry companies now occupied Villa Rogatti, German Panzergrenadier forces still maintained substantial defences on the outskirts of the town. However, C Company continued to advance steadily along the eastern side of the town, encountering significant resistance from the 361st Panzergrenadier Regiment ( 361. Panzergrenadier @-@ Regiment ). After approximately an hour of fighting by C and D Companies, Villa Rogatti had been occupied by Canadian forces shortly before dawn.

The case against Goode was essentially circumstantial, but the jury <unk> the district attorney's call for assertive punishment of " crimes of violence " and convicted him. There were calls for Briggs to commute Goode's capital sentence, but he refused, writing " A pardon here would tend toward the utter subversion of the law. " 
<|endoftext|> Not long after the Goode case came the sensational trial of Professor John White Webster in the murder of George <unk>, a crime that took place at the Harvard Medical School in November 1849. The trial received nationwide coverage, and the prosecution case was based on evidence that was either circumstantial ( complicated by the fact that a complete corpse was not found ), or founded on new types of evidence ( forensic dentistry was used for the first time in this trial ). Furthermore, Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice <unk> Shaw was widely criticized for bias in the instructions he gave to the jury. Briggs was petitioned to commute Webster's sentence by death penalty opponents, and even threatened with physical harm if he did not. He refused however, stating that the evidence in the case was clear ( especially after Webster gave a confession ), and that there was no reason to doubt that the court had acted with due and proper <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> During Briggs'time as governor, abolitionist activists continued to make <unk> against both the Whigs and Democrats, primarily making common cause with the Democrats against the dominant Whigs.

He did promote other types of reform, supporting Horace Mann in his activities to improve education in the state. 
<|endoftext|> In 1849, Briggs failed to secure a majority in the popular vote because of the rise in power of the Free Soil Party, but the Whig legislature returned him to office. In the 1850 election, anger over the <unk> of 1850 ( a series of federal acts designed to preserve the unity of the nation which included the <unk> Slave Act ) prompted the Democrats and Free <unk> to form a coalition to gain control over the Massachusetts legislature, and divided the Whigs along <unk> and <unk> lines.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Plot = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The story of Mega Man & Bass varies slightly depending on which player character is chosen. It begins One year after <unk> 8 when a robot villain named King breaks into Dr. Wily's laboratory and then the Robot Museum to collect the data blueprints for the creations of Dr. Light. Dr. Light alerts the hero Mega Man that he must go at once to the Robot Museum to confront this new enemy. Meanwhile, Bass ( Mega Man's rival and Wily's greatest creation ) hears of the new criminal's appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating King. Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King <unk> his plan to him ; he desires to create a <unk> in which robots rule the world over humans. To accomplish this, King seeks to create an <unk> army using the data and invites Proto Man to join him. Proto Man refuses and attempts to attack, but King <unk> and <unk> his body in half. Proto Man then <unk> back to the lab for repairs while King escapes with the data, instructing his <unk> to handle the heroes. With their own motivations, Mega Man and Bass set out to put a stop to King's plans. 
<|endoftext|> After vanquishing eight powerful robots under allegiance to King ( Cold Man, Astro Man, Ground Man, Magic Man, Tengu Man, Dynamo Man, Pirate Man, and Burner Man ), the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat. Proto Man interrupts the fight and again attempts to defeat their new nemesis. <unk> all of his remaining energy into a blast, Proto Man manages to destroy King's shield and loses consciousness, allowing Mega Man and Bass to best King in battle afterwards. King questions why they fight so hard for humans when robots are the superior species. The pair explains that humans are the ones who created robots in the first place, which <unk> King. The villain reveals that his creator is Dr. Wily, who then appears on a video monitor. When King asks the evil inventor why robots fight each other for the sake of humans, Wily strengthens his " brainwashing level " and <unk> his power. Mega Man and Bass engage King in another battle and defeat him, but not before the latter <unk> Proto Man out of his castle. The castle begins a self @-@ destruct sequence and the protagonists escape without King. 
<|endoftext|> Mega Man and Bass begin a final confrontation with Dr. Wily in his newly regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands to know why he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass'abilities. Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be <unk> together. Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Wily then demands Bass to destroy Proto Man, but Bass is unsure. It was then Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight. Bass doesn 't care and forces Proto Man to leave, saying that he will still destroy Mega Man to prove his cause. Mega Man returns home where his sister Roll presents him a letter from King, who has somehow escaped the destruction of his castle. King wishes to atone for his own crimes against humans and hopes for them to be friends if they were to meet in the future. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Gameplay = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The gameplay in Mega Man & Bass is similar to earlier games in the series. The player is tasked with completing a series of action @-@ platform stages while overcoming obstacles, solving minor puzzles, and battling enemies. Destroying the " Robot Master " boss at the end of a stage lets the player acquire its special weapon. In previous games, the player generally took on the role of the hero Mega Man. In this game, the player can choose to start the game as either Mega Man or Bass. However, whichever character is picked must be used for the rest of the game and cannot be changed. Mega Man is able to charge his shots to make them more powerful and has the ability to slide along the ground. Bass is able to rapidly fire his arm cannon in eight directions, though shots cannot be fired while moving or pass through walls unless a certain upgrade is obtained. Bass is also able to double @-@ jump ( jump a second time in mid @-@ air ) and dash along the ground. Performing both simultaneously lets him cross great distances by doing a dash @-@ jump. 
<|endoftext|> The stage structure is different from other games in the
<|endoftext|> to minimise the conflict of interest between the railway company and the dining @-@ car operator. They also saw <unk> operations as a way to <unk> a larger share of the revenue to the railway company, and to ensure a high quality of service on new lines. At that time the <unk> Line and Dovre Line were in the planning stages, and the NSB intended to introduce dining services on these when they opened. Oslo East Station and its restaurant were operated by the private Norwegian Trunk Railway. In an agreement signed on 18 September 1918 both railway companies agreed that a new restaurant operator would be controlled by the Norwegian Trunk Railway, but this company had to abide by the NSB's decision of how many restaurant carriages to operate on any line. 
<|endoftext|> This model was inspired by Sweden, where a separate dining company had been established ; this company paid the railway company part of its revenue and a fixed fee per restaurant carriage. The Swedish model involved including the operation of station restaurants at locations where the restaurant carriages would have depots. On 21 December 1918, <unk> Norsk Spisevognselskap was established with a share capital of 200 @,@ 000 Norwegian <unk> ( NOK ). It had 20 shares ; 17 were owned by the Trunk Railway, and one by each of three directors : Waldemar <unk> Platou, <unk> <unk> and Christian Emil <unk> Platou — the former representing the Trunk Railway and the latter being director @-@ general of the NSB. In January 1919, Waldemar Platou was appointed chair and Christiansen managing director. The company took over Christiansen's four restaurant carriages and the restaurant at Oslo Ø on 1 April 1919. 
<|endoftext|> On 2 February 1926, Parliament voted to <unk> the Trunk Railway. During the debate, the organisation of Spisevognselskapet was criticised ; with the <unk>, the state became the sole owner of Spisevognselskapet. On 31 March 1927, the Ministry of Labour recommended that the company remain a state @-@ owned limited company ; the minority in parliament wanted a state enterprise. During the 1930s, <unk> <unk> was managing director of Norsk Spisevognselskap. In 1948, <unk> <unk> was appointed managing director of the company. He was succeeded by Knut <unk> in 1960. The company had 75 employees in 1919, and 591 in 1949. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Restaurant carriages = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The restaurant carriages of the NSS were open to everyone, but dining was so expensive that only passengers travelling in first class used the service. Usually, three or four dishes were offered in the restaurant carriages. A four @-@ course dinner cost five Norwegian <unk> in the 1920s, which was expensive at the time. Warm dishes, such as <unk> and <unk>, were usually prepared at a small stove in the restaurant carriage's kitchen. On busy days, prepared <unk> were delivered from rail depots. The kitchens were staffed by two maids and one attendant. <unk> of ice were often used instead of <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> With the opening of the Dovre Line, Spisevognselskapet established dining @-@ car service on 25 June 1921. In 1921 a train ride from <unk> to Trondheim lasted approximately 15 hours, and the average waiting time at each station was between 10 and 15 minutes. On 1 July 1925 dining service was introduced on the <unk> Line, from 1 July 1926 on the <unk> Line, from May 1934 on the <unk> Line and from 15 May 1936 on the Røros Line. In 1948 210 @,@ 000 meals were served on board, in addition to sandwiches and drinks. The company also offered a light breakfast on night trains on the <unk>, <unk> and Dovre lines. During the Second World War, dining @-@ car service was discontinued. 
<|endoftext|> After the war trains faced competition from aviation and automobiles, and serving trolleys were installed on Norwegian trains. In 1965 cart service on trains was centralised and standardised ; food service was faster, and prices were lowered. During the 1970s <unk> cars were used, where passengers could serve themselves.

He argues that love is what he needs least and dismisses it by questioning what " love " actually means ( " What is Love? and where is it? " ). He rejects ambition, but it requires more work ( " And for that poor Ambition — it springs / From a man's little heart's short fever @-@ fit ; " ). Unlike the personas of Love and Ambition, the narrator is unable to find a reason to <unk> Poesy ( Poetry ), which reflects the poets'inner conflict : should he abandon poetry to focus on a career in which he can earn a decent living?

With regard to the historical accuracy of the book, Vargas Llosa has said " It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties. The only limitation I imposed on myself was that I was not going to <unk> anything that couldn 't have happened within the framework of life in the Dominican Republic. I have respected the basic facts, but I have changed and deformed many things in order to make the story more persuasive — and I have not exaggerated. "

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The realist style of The Feast of the Goat is recognized by some reviewers as being a break from a more allegorical approach to the dictator novel. The novel received largely positive reviews, most of which were willing to accept sacrifices of historical accuracy in favour of good storytelling. 
<|endoftext|> A common comment on the novel is the graphic nature of the many acts of torture and murder which are depicted in the novel. Vargas lets the reader see the <unk> of an oppressive regime with a degree of detail not often used by his <unk> in Latin American literature, as Michael Wood suggests in the London Review of Books : " Vargas Llosa... tells us far more about the details of day @-@ to @-@ day intrigue, and the <unk>, sadistic <unk> of torture and murder. " Walter Kirn of the New York Times suggests that the " <unk> scenes of dungeon <unk> and torture sessions " cast other aspects of the novel in a pale light, draining them of their significance and impact. Similarly, Kirn implies that the " narrative machinery " mentioned by Wood as being somewhat unwieldy also produces a largely superfluous storyline. The plot line centered on Urania Cabral is described by <unk> as being an emotional centre that focuses the novel, and Wood agrees that her confrontations with past demons hold the readers attention. In contrast, Kirn's review states that Urania's segments are " <unk> and atmospheric... [ and ] seem to be on loan from another sort of book. " 
<|endoftext|> Most reviews of The Feast of the Goat make either indirect of direct reference to the relationship between sexuality and power. Salon reviewer Laura Miller, writer for The Observer Jonathan <unk>, Walter Kirn, and Michael Wood each detail the connection between Trujillo's gradual loss of ultimate control, both over his body and his followers. The means by which Trujillo reinforces political power through sexual acts and begins to lose personal conviction as his body fails him are topics of frequent discussion among reviewers.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Humpty Dumpty is a character in an English nursery rhyme, probably originally a riddle and one of the best known in the English @-@ speaking world. He is typically portrayed as an anthropomorphic egg, though he is not explicitly described so. The first recorded versions of the rhyme date from late eighteenth @-@ century England and the tune from 1870 in James William Elliott's National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs. Its origins are obscure and several theories have been advanced to suggest original meanings. 
<|endoftext|> The character of Humpty Dumpty was popularised in the United States by actor George L. Fox ( 1825 – 77 ). As a character and literary allusion, he has appeared or been referred to in a large number of works of literature and popular culture, particularly Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking @-@ Glass ( 1872 ).

The melody commonly associated with the rhyme was first recorded by composer and nursery rhyme collector James William Elliott in his National Nursery Rhymes and Nursery Songs ( London, 1870 ). The Roud Folk Song Index catalogues folk songs and their variations by number, and classifies this song as <unk>.

<|endoftext|> According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term " <unk> <unk> " referred to a drink of brandy boiled with <unk> in the seventeenth century. The riddle probably exploited, for <unk>, the fact that " <unk> <unk> " was also eighteenth @-@ century <unk> slang for a short and clumsy person. The riddle may depend upon the assumption that a clumsy person falling off a wall might not be <unk> damaged, whereas an egg would be. The rhyme is no longer posed as a riddle, since the answer is now so well known. Similar <unk> have been recorded by folklorists in other languages, such as " <unk> <unk> " in French, " <unk> <unk> " in Swedish and Norwegian, and " <unk> @-@ <unk> " or " <unk> @-@ <unk> " in different parts of Germany — although none is as widely known as Humpty Dumpty is in English. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Meaning = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The rhyme does not explicitly state that the subject is an egg, possibly because it may have been originally posed as a riddle. There are also various theories of an original " Humpty Dumpty ". One, advanced by Katherine <unk> Thomas in 1930 and adopted by Robert Ripley, posits that Humpty Dumpty is King Richard III of England, depicted as <unk> in Tudor histories and particularly in Shakespeare's play, and who was defeated, despite his armies, at Bosworth Field in <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Professor David <unk> suggested in The Oxford Magazine of 16 February 1956 that Humpty Dumpty was a " tortoise " siege engine, an armoured frame, used unsuccessfully to approach the walls of the Parliamentary held city of Gloucester in 1643 during the Siege of Gloucester in the English Civil War. This was on the basis of a contemporary account of the attack, but without evidence that the rhyme was connected. The theory was part of an anonymous series of articles on the origin of nursery rhymes and was widely acclaimed in academia, but it was derided by others as " ingenuity for ingenuity's sake " and declared to be a spoof. The link was nevertheless popularised by a children's opera All the King's Men by Richard Rodney Bennett, first performed in 1969.

<|endoftext|> During 1968, Cambodia's indigenous communist movement, labeled Khmer Rouge ( Red <unk> ) by Sihanouk, began an insurgency to overthrow the government. While they received very limited material help from the North Vietnamese at the time ( the Hanoi government had no incentive to overthrow Sihanouk, since it was satisfied with his continued " neutrality " ), they were able to shelter their forces in areas controlled by PAVN / NLF troops.

To accomplish this, President Lyndon B.

The president initially refused, but the breaking point came with the launching of PAVN's " Mini @-@ <unk> " Offensive of 1969 within South Vietnam. Nixon, angered at what he perceived as a violation of the " agreement " with Hanoi after the cessation of the bombing of North Vietnam, authorized the covert air campaign. The first mission of Operation Menu was dispatched on 18 March and by the time it was completed 14 months later more than 3 @,@ 000 sorties had been flown and 108 @,@ 000 tons of ordnance had been dropped on eastern Cambodia.

The prince, outraged that his " <unk> <unk> " with the communists had been disturbed, immediately arranged for a trip to Moscow and Beijing in an attempt to gain their agreement to apply pressure on Hanoi to <unk> its forces in Cambodia. 
<|endoftext|> On 18 March, the Cambodian National Assembly deposed Sihanouk and named Lon Nol as provisional head of state. This led Sihanouk to immediately establish a government @-@ in @-@ exile in Beijing and to ally himself with North Vietnam, the Khmer Rouge, the NLF, and the <unk> <unk> Lao. In doing so, Sihanouk lent his name and popularity in the rural areas of Cambodia to a movement over which he had little control. The North Vietnamese response to the coup was swift. PAVN began directly supplying large amounts of weapons and advisors to the Khmer Rouge, and Cambodia plunged into civil war.

They then floated downstream into South Vietnam. Cambodia's actions were denounced by both the North and South Vietnamese governments. 
<|endoftext|> Even before the supply conduit through Sihanoukville was shut down, PAVN had begun expanding its logistical system from southeastern Laos ( the Ho Chi Minh trail ) into northeastern Cambodia. PAVN also launched an offensive ( Campaign X ) against the Cambodian army, quickly seizing large portions of the eastern and northeastern parts of the country, isolating and besieging or overrunning a number of Cambodian cities including Kampong Cham. Communist forces then approached within 20 miles ( 32 km ) of the capital, Phnom Penh, spurring President Nixon into action.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Braathens SAFE was also given the right to fly its first international scheduled flights for the first time in several decades. On 19 August 1988, the airline was granted concession to fly to Billund in Denmark. At the same time, Air @-@ X was granted concession to fly the route via Sandefjord and <unk>. The route started on 2 May 1989. Previously the rules stated that if SAS flew to a non @-@ Scandinavian destination from any capital, no other Scandinavian airlines could fly to that city.

On 18 May 1990, Braathens SAFE was awarded the concession a route from Oslo, Bergen and Stavanger to Newcastle, which opened on 3 April 1991.

<|endoftext|> On 19 June 1990, SAS announced that all its services to London Gatwick Airport would be moved to London Heathrow Airport, where most of its services had landed. The same day, the Ministry of Transport announced that any Scandinavian airline could apply for and receive concessions to fly to Gatwick. On 25 June, Braathens SAFE applied to fly to London, but instead wanted to fly to London <unk> Airport, to have better landing slots. The concession was granted on 18 January 1991, but the airline chose to not start the route. The company had been granted a concession to <unk> in Sweden, and the route opened on 2 May 1991 with two daily departures. This was later reduced to one. In October 1992, the two airlines that flew from Oslo to Gatwick, Norway Airlines and Dan @-@ Air, filed for <unk>. Braathens SAFE immediately decided to start the route, with a departure at about 10 : 30 that would allow connections to the rest of the domestic network. Six days later, the first schedules were published in the newspaper, slots and British permission was granted three days after that. Another two days after that, the service started. 
<|endoftext|> At the time, Denmark was a member of the European Union ( EU ), while Sweden and Norway had applied and were awaiting referenda to determine membership. EU was working to <unk> the airline market from 1995, which could cause problems for the Scandinavian agreements. In preparation for this, Braathens SAFE started negotiations with Linjeflyg of Sweden and <unk> Air of Denmark to <unk> an alliance to compete with SAS. In particular, the three airlines wanted to capture the two million passengers that travelled between the three Scandinavian capitals : Oslo, Copenhagen and Stockholm. Instead, SAS was given permission to purchase Linjeflyg in exchange for the Swedish airline market being <unk> from 1 July 1992. From 23 October 1992, the Norwegian Armed Forces stopped <unk> aircraft and started using scheduled flights to fly 240 @,@ 000 personnel annually.

Flowers would be flown in from all over the country, and as far away as Chile. Despite the fact that Eva Perón never held a political office, she was eventually given a state funeral usually reserved for a head of state, along with a full Roman Catholic <unk> mass. A memorial was held for the Argentine team during the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki due to Eva Perón's death during those games.

Time magazine reported that the Peronist government enforced the observance of a daily period of five minutes of mourning following a daily radio announcement. 
<|endoftext|> During Perón's time, children born to unmarried parents did not have the same legal rights as those born to married parents. Biographer Julie M.

Defensive shots rarely score runs and risk being caught in the cordon, while the pull and hook shots can result in a catch on the boundary, for which two men were usually set in " leg @-@ theory " bowling. Leg theory had been practised previously without resort to short @-@ pitched bowling, usually by slow or medium @-@ pace bowlers. This type of leg theory was aimed outside the line of leg stump ; the object being to test the batsman's patience and force a rash stroke. It was occasionally an effective tactic, but was unattractive for spectators and never became widely used except by a handful of specialists such as Fred Root, the Worcestershire bowler and Warwick Armstrong, the former Australian captain. 
<|endoftext|> However, there had been instances of what would later be recognised as bodyline prior to 1932. In 1925, Australian Jack Scott first bowled a form of bodyline in a state match for New South Wales, but his captain Herbie Collins disliked it and would not let him use it again when he was captain. Other Australian captains were less particular, including Vic Richardson who let him use those tactics when he moved to South Australia. He repeated them against the MCC in 1928 – 29. In 1927, in a Test trial match, " <unk> " Clark bowled short to a leg @-@ trap field. He was representing England in a side captained by Jardine. In 1928 – 29, Harry Alexander bowled an early form of bodyline at the MCC tourists. Larwood used a form of bodyline on that same tour, bowling fast leg theory to a leg @-@ side field in two Test matches, although not with the same intensity and duration as came later. Bob Wyatt later claimed that Learie Constantine unsuccessfully used bodyline in 1929 – 30 in the West Indies.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Jardine's first experience against Australia came when his Oxford University team played against the 1921 Australian touring side. In the second innings, Jardine was 96 not out when the game ended, having batted his team to safety. The tourists were criticised in the press for not allowing Jardine to reach his hundred, but they had tried to help him with some easy bowling. There has been speculation that this incident helped develop Jardine's antipathy towards Australians, although Christopher Douglas denies this. Cricket historian David <unk> believed it is possible that the <unk> Australian captain Warwick Armstrong could have addressed sarcastic comments to Jardine but Wisden believed his slow approach cost him his century. 
<|endoftext|> Regardless of what happened in 1921, Jardine's conflicts with Australia solidified after he was selected to tour the country in 1928 – 29. He began the tour with three consecutive hundreds. During the first century, the crowd engaged in some good @-@ natured joking at Jardine's expense, but he was <unk> by the crowd during his second hundred for batting too slowly. Jardine accelerated after another slow start, during which he was again barracked to score his third century. The crowds took an increasing dislike to him, mainly for his superior attitude and bearing, his awkward fielding, and particularly his choice of <unk>. His first public action in South Australia was to take out the members of the South Australian team who had been to Oxford or Cambridge universities. Then, he wore a <unk> cap, given to successful cricketers at Oxford. It was not unusual for Oxford and Cambridge cricketers to wear similar caps while batting, as both Jardine and MCC captain Percy Chapman did so on this tour, although it was slightly unorthodox to wear them while fielding. However, this was neither understood nor acceptable to the Australian crowds. They quickly took exception to the importance he seemed to place on class distinction. Although Jardine may simply have worn the cap out of superstition, it conveyed a negative impression to the spectators ; his general <unk> drew one comment of " Where's the butler to carry the bat for you? " Jardine's cap became a focus for criticism and mockery from the crowds throughout the tour. Nevertheless, Jack Fingleton later claimed that Jardine could have won over the crowd by exchanging jokes or <unk> with them. It is certain that Jardine by this stage had developed an intense dislike for Australian crowds. During his third century at the start of

<|endoftext|> Hannah de Rothschild's father Baron Meyer <unk> de Rothschild married his cousin <unk> Cohen in 1850. The marriage provided the <unk> for Meyer to create what he described as " an enduring monument, " a country house of monumental proportions. His daughter Hannah, aged just six months, laid the foundation stone on 31 December 1851. Throughout her life, Mentmore Towers was to be a fixed and pivotal point. 
<|endoftext|> Within a few years of the mansion's completion, attracted by the good hunting and proximity to London, Hannah's relatives began to build estates nearby, all within a carriage drive of each other ; thus, Hannah grew up in an almost private world of <unk> <unk> and security. <unk> has described this <unk> of Rothschild properties as " the most conspicuous and significant aspect of Victorian architecture in Buckinghamshire. " In addition to Mentmore, Baron and Baroness Meyer de Rothschild had a large house in London, 107 Piccadilly ; The <unk>, a luxurious yacht moored in the South of France ; and other smaller properties visited only seasonally and occasionally. 
<|endoftext|> As an only child growing up in what were, in all but name, palaces, her childhood appears to have been quite lonely. She was a companion to her <unk> mother and, in later life, a hostess with her father during her mother's long periods of <unk>. She was indulged by both parents and her formal education was neglected in favour of music and singing lessons, subjects in which she was accomplished. Her parents were very protective of her, attempting to ensure that she was never exposed to the risk of sickness or even the sight of poverty. As a result, she was never allowed to enter the cottages on the Rothschilds'estates. A cousin, who seems to have disliked her, claims that Hannah was so sheltered that the phrase " the poor " was just a meaningless <unk> to her. This is likely to be an exaggeration, as from her teens onwards she used much of her fortune to improve the lot of the poor, in housing and education. Whatever the faults of her education, she possessed great confidence, impressing her Rothschild relations, who noted her poise and competence when she hosted a large house party at Mentmore for the Prince of Wales while only 17 years of age. 
<|endoftext|> Mayer <unk> de Rothschild died in 1874, leaving his daughter not only Mentmore ( with its <unk> art collection ), his London mansion, and <unk> investments, but also the sum of two million pounds sterling in cash ( equivalent to £ 167 million in present day terms ). Thus, Hannah de Rothschild became the wealthiest woman in England.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The Battle of Tellicherry was a naval action fought off the Indian port of Tellicherry between British and French warships on 18 November 1791 during the Third Anglo @-@ Mysore War. Britain and France were not at war at the time of the engagement, but French support for the Kingdom of Mysore in the conflict with the British East India Company had led to Royal Navy patrols stopping and searching French ships sailing for the Mysorean port of Mangalore. When a French convoy from Mahé passed the British port of Tellicherry in November 1791, Commodore William Cornwallis sent a small squadron to intercept the French ships. 
<|endoftext|> As the British force under Captain Sir Richard Strachan approached the convoy, the escorting frigate Résolue opened fire. A general action followed, with Strachan succeeding in forcing the French ship to surrender within twenty minutes and both sides suffering damage and casualties. All of the French vessels were searched and subsequently returned to Mahé, the local French authorities reacting furiously at what they perceived as a violation of their neutral position. <unk> were sent back to France reporting the action from Commodore Saint @-@ Félix but they evoked little response. Although under normal circumstances the battle might have provoked a diplomatic incident, the upheavals of the ongoing French Revolution meant that the despatches had little effect.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In December 1789, after five years of diplomatic wrangling about the terms of the Treaty of Mangalore that had ended the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War, the ruler of Mysore Tipu Sultan again declared war on the British East India Company and their allies in Southern India. For the next two years the war continued as British forces and their allies drove the Mysore armies back towards the capital of <unk>. Both sides were reliant on supply by sea to maintain their campaigns inland : the British forces were supported from their major ports at Bombay and Madras, later <unk> additional forces at the small port of Tellicherry inside Mysore territory. The Mysorean forces were supplied through Mangalore by French ships. France had been an ally of the Tipu Sultan's father <unk> Ali during the Second Anglo @-@ Mysore War and although the political instability caused by the French Revolution in Europe prevented active involvement, they ensured that their ships kept up a supply of equipment to Mysore throughout the war. 
<|endoftext|> In an effort to eliminate French support Commodore William Cornwallis, the British naval commander in the region, stationed a squadron of frigates at Tellicherry, where they were ideally situated to blockade Mangalore and prevent the passage of shipping into Mysorean territory. The squadron consisted of Cornwallis in HMS Minerva, Captain Sir Richard Strachan in HMS Phoenix and HMS <unk> under Captain Isaac Smith. The French operated a squadron of their own on the coast, led by Commodore Saint @-@ Félix and consisting of two frigates based at Mahé, a small French port 7 miles ( 11 km ) south of Tellicherry. The French had communicated to the British at Tellicherry that they would not submit to any attempts to search their vessels, but Strachan and Cornwallis replied that they would enforce the blockade of Mangalore whatever the consequences.

As Smith halted the merchant ships and sent boats to inspect them, Strachan did the same to Résolue, <unk> the French captain and placing an officer in a small boat to board the frigate. The French captain was outraged at this violation of his neutrality, and responded by opening fire : British sources suggest that his initial target was the small boat, although Phoenix was the ship most immediately damaged. 
<|endoftext|> Strachan was <unk> at the French reaction, and returned fire immediately, the proximity of the ships preventing any manoeuvres. Within twenty minutes the combat was decided, the French captain <unk> down his colours with his ship battered and more than 60 men wounded or dead. The French ship carried significantly weaker cannon than Phoenix, with 6 and 12 pounder guns to the 9 and 18 pounders aboard the British squadron. In addition, Résolue was heavily outnumbered : no other French warships were in the area while the British had three large frigates within sight.
<|endoftext|> 1959. He had developed the book's core ideas from his doctoral dissertation. It was Goffman's first and most famous book, for which he received the American Sociological Association's 1961 <unk> Award. 
<|endoftext|> Goffman describes the theatrical performances that occur in face @-@ to @-@ face interactions. He holds that when an individual comes in contact with another person, he attempts to control or guide the impression that the other person will form of him, by altering his own setting, appearance and manner. At the same time, the person that the individual is interacting with attempts to form an impression of, and obtain information about, the individual. Goffman also believes that participants in social interactions engage in certain practices to avoid embarrassing themselves or others. Society is not <unk> ; we must act differently in different settings. This recognition led Goffman to his dramaturgical analysis. He saw a connection between the kinds of " acts " that people put on in their daily lives and theatrical performances. In a social interaction, as in a theatrical performance, there is an onstage area where actors ( individuals ) appear before the audience ; this is where positive self @-@ concepts and desired impressions are offered. But there is, as well, a backstage – a hidden, private area where individuals can be themselves and drop their societal roles and identities. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Asylums = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Goffman is sometimes credited with having in 1957 coined the term " total institution ", though Fine and Manning note that he had heard it in lectures by Everett Hughes in reference to any type of institution in which people are treated alike and in which behavior is regulated. Regardless of whether Goffman coined the term " total institution ", he popularized it with his 1961 book, Asylums : Essays on the Social Situation of Mental Patients and Other Inmates. The book has been described as " ethnography of the concept of the total institution ". The book was one of the first sociological examinations of the social situation of mental patients in psychiatric hospitals and a major contribution to understanding of social aspects of mental illness. 
<|endoftext|> The book is composed of four essays : " Characteristics of Total <unk> " ( 1957 ) ; " The <unk> Career of the Mental <unk> " ( 1959 ) ; " The <unk> of a Public Institution : A Study of Ways of Making Out in a Mental Hospital " ; and " The Medical Model and Mental <unk> : Some Notes on the <unk> of the <unk> Trades ". The first three essays focus on the experiences of patients ; the last, on professional @-@ client interactions. Goffman is mainly concerned with the details of psychiatric hospitalization and with the nature and effects of the process he calls " <unk> ". He describes how <unk> <unk> people into the role of a good patient, someone " dull, harmless and inconspicuous " – a condition which in turn reinforces notions of <unk> in severe mental illness. Total institutions greatly affect people's interactions ; yet, even in such places, people find ways to redefine their roles and reclaim their identities. 
<|endoftext|> Asylums has been credited with helping <unk> the reform of mental health systems in a number of countries, leading to reductions in the numbers of large mental hospitals and of the individuals locked up in them. It has also been influential in the anti @-@ <unk> movement.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In Behavior in Public Places ( 1963 ), Goffman again focuses on everyday public interactions. He draws distinctions between several types of public gatherings ( " gatherings ", " situations ", " social occasions " ) and types of audiences ( acquainted versus <unk> ).

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In October 1913, Innis started classes at McMaster University ( then in Toronto ). McMaster was a natural choice for him because it was a Baptist university and many students who attended Woodstock College went there. McMaster's liberal arts professors encouraged critical thinking and debate. Innis was especially influenced by James Ten <unk>, the university's one @-@ man philosophy department. Ten <unk> posed an essay question that Innis pondered for the rest of his life : " Why do we attend to the things to which we attend? " 
<|endoftext|> Before his final undergraduate year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer teaching at the Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of <unk> near <unk>, Alberta. The experience gave him a sense of the <unk> of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs. In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer <unk> Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = First World War service = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> After graduating from McMaster, Innis felt that his Christian principles compelled him to enlist in the Canadian Expeditionary Force.

<|endoftext|> Innis's role as an artillery <unk> gave him firsthand experience of life ( and death ) on the front lines as he participated in the successful Canadian attack on <unk> Ridge. <unk>, or <unk>, watched where each artillery shell landed, then sent back aiming corrections so that the next shells could hit their targets more accurately. On July 7, 1917, Innis received a serious shrapnel wound in his right thigh that required eight months of hospital treatment in England. 
<|endoftext|> Innis's war was over. His biographer, John Watson, notes the physical wound took seven years to heal, but the psychological damage lasted a lifetime. Innis suffered recurring bouts of depression and nervous exhaustion because of his military service. 
<|endoftext|> Watson also notes that the Great War influenced Innis's intellectual outlook. It strengthened his Canadian nationalism ; sharpened his opinion of what he thought were the destructive effects of technology, including the communications media that were used so effectively to " sell " the war ; and led him, for the first time, to doubt his Baptist faith.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Harold Innis completed a Master of Arts at McMaster, graduating in April 1918. His thesis, called The <unk> Soldier, " was a detailed description of the public policy measures that were necessary, not only to provide a supportive milieu to help veterans get over the effects of the war, but also to move on with national reconstruction ". 
<|endoftext|> Innis did his <unk> work at the University of Chicago and was awarded his PhD in August 1920. His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and <unk> neoclassical theories, then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies. 
<|endoftext|> Innis was influenced by the university's two eminent communications scholars, George Herbert Mead and Robert E. Park. Although he did not attend any of these famous professors'classes, Innis did absorb their idea that communication involved much more than the transmission of information. James W. Carey writes that Mead and Park " characterized communication as the entire process whereby a culture is brought into existence, maintained in time, and <unk> into institutions ". 
<|endoftext|> While at Chicago, Innis was exposed to the ideas of <unk> Veblen, the <unk> thinker who drew on his deep knowledge of philosophy and economics to write scathing critiques of contemporary thought and culture. Veblen had left Chicago years before, but his ideas were still strongly felt there. Years later, in an essay on Veb

While Tennyson's character cannot recognise beauty within nature, Gaskell's character is able to turn to nature to gain spiritually in a manner similar to the Romantic poems, including <unk> Abbey by William <unk> or This <unk> @-@ Tree <unk> My Prison by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. There is also a connection with Mariana's condition and the condition within Coleridge's <unk> : An Ode. However, the narrator at the end of <unk> is able to be <unk> into movement whereas Mariana never reaches that point. Furthermore, Mariana is unlike the Romantic poems because the character is not one with nature or able to achieve <unk> through imagination. Furthermore, there is little outside of Mariana that exists within the poem as Mariana's mood does not respond to changes in nature. 
<|endoftext|> In terms of Tennyson's other poems, there is a strong connection between the character Mariana and Tennyson's other female characters. Both Mariana and Oriana have characters that experience a mental imprisonment, which are revealed in the poetic <unk>. However, Oriana is able to have control over her own story when she serves as narrator of it while Mariana is denied control by Tennyson's use of a third @-@ person narrative structure. The difference is further compounded by Oriana's imprisonment coming from her own memories while Mariana's is the external results of her lover having not returned. The character Fatima of Fatima is connected to Mariana simply because she is a reversal of Mariana's character : Fatima, like Mariana, <unk> for her lover but suffers from an intense passion that causes her to lose control over her mind while also being able to experience the world around her. The character <unk> of <unk> is a combination of aspects from both Mariana's and Fatima's characters. In the revised version Mariana in the South, the second Mariana is similar to the Lady of Shalott in that they both live in a world between fantasy and reality.

<|endoftext|> Harold <unk>, in 1923, view the <unk> of Mariana and Tennyson's other early works as an aspect that makes the early works better his later works. In T. S.

Later in 1972, Christopher Ricks argues that the poem is " one of Tennyson's masterpieces in the art of the penultimate. " 
<|endoftext|> Elaine Jordan argues, in her 1988 analysis of Tennyson's works, that the poem's depiction of " self @-@ <unk> [... ] is a negation which involves the drawing @-@ in of forces in order perhaps to assert the self differently.

<|endoftext|> After the war, the Australian Army moved away from the machine gun battalion concept and no similar units were raised. The machine gun role was subsumed into the support companies of individual infantry battalions. The idea was arguably misunderstood by Australian commanders throughout the war and this may have influenced the decision to move away from the concept. When the units had been established, the intent had been for machine gun battalions to provide highly mobile fire support but this only worked where the principles of open warfare worked. Once the focus of Australian Army combat operations shifted to the Pacific, the machine gun battalions were largely misused, being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets or for <unk> tasks, rather than as offensive weapons for long range fire support. The medium machine guns were also largely used in the same manner as light machine guns, such as the Bren. Other reasons identified for the concept's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders, a preference for organic fire support over attached sub @-@ units, over @-@ estimating the difficulty of transporting Vickers guns in the jungle and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen.

Subsequent <unk>, <unk> and English @-@ speaking peoples have influenced the history of Skye ; the relationships between their names for the island are not straightforward.

The original building was constructed in 1840 as part of a worldwide research project run by Edward Sabine to determine the cause of fluctuations in magnetic declination. Measurements from the Toronto site demonstrated that <unk> were responsible for this effect on Earth's magnetic field. When this project concluded in 1853, the observatory was greatly expanded by the Canadian government and served as the country's primary meteorological station and official <unk> for over fifty years.

The astronomer Edmund Halley noted this and the problems it would cause for navigation in 1701. It was also believed that whatever was causing this effect might be causing changes in the weather, and that studying magnetic variations might lead to better weather prediction. 
<|endoftext|> In 1833 the British Association for the Advancement of Science commissioned a series of magnetic measurements across the United Kingdom. Under the direction of Major Edward Sabine of the Royal Artillery, a multi @-@ year measuring project began, with the results to be published in 1838. As the measurements were being made a number of proposals were put forth to expand the program worldwide. In 1836 the German explorer and naturalist Alexander von Humboldt wrote to Prince Augustus Frederick, Duke of Sussex, then President of the Royal Society, stating that a formal program was important to a nation with dominions spread across the globe. At the seventh meeting of the British Association in Liverpool in 1837, Sabine declared that " the magnetism of the earth cannot be counted less than one of the most important branches of the physical history of the planet we inhabit " and mapping its variations would be " regarded by our contemporaries and by <unk> as a fitting enterprise of a maritime people ; and a worthy achievement of a nation which has ever sought to rank foremost in every <unk> undertaking ". 
<|endoftext|> In 1837, the British Government funded the installation of a magnetic observatory at Greenwich. The Association continued to press for the construction of similar observatories around the world, and in 1838 their suggestions were accepted by the Government and funds were provided. In 1839 the British Government and the Royal Society prepared four expeditions to build magnetic observation stations in Cape Town ; St. Helena ; Hobart, Tasmania and ( eventually ) Toronto. Teams of Royal Artillery officers were sent out to take the measurements. The team assigned to Canada originally planned to build their observatory on Saint Helen's Island off Montreal, but the local rocks proved to have a high magnetic influence, and the decision was made to move to Toronto instead. The team arrived in 1839, and set up camp at Fort York in a disused barracks while construction started on new buildings. The observatory was given 10 acres ( 4 @.@ 0 ha ) of land to the west of King's College ; the Ontario Legislature now occupies the area on which the college was located. 
<|endoftext|> The observatory, officially " Her Majesty's <unk> and Meteorological Observatory at Toronto ", was completed the following year. It consisted of two log buildings, one for the magnetic instruments and the other a smaller semi @-@ buried building nearby for " experimental <unk> ". The north end of the main building was connected to a small conical dome which contained a <unk> used to make astronomical measurements for the accurate determination of the local time. The buildings were constructed with as little metal as possible ; when metal was required, non @-@ magnetic materials such as brass or copper were used. A small barracks was built nearby to house the crew. 
<|endoftext|> Using the measurements from the Toronto and Hobart sites, Sabine noticed both short @-@ term fluctuations in magnetic declination over a period of hours, and longer @-@ term variations over months.

In 1916, the original author, Brown, published a more detailed description which was also based on AMNH <unk>, which specimen is therefore the <unk>. Corythosaurus is among many lambeosaurines that possess crests, and it was the crest that lends Corythosaurus its name. The generic name Corythosaurus is derived from Greek <unk>, <unk>, " Corinthian helmet ", and means " <unk> lizard ". The specific name casuarius refers to the cassowary, a bird with a similar skull crest.

In 1975 Peter Dodson studied the differences between the skulls and crests of different species of lambeosaurine dinosaurs. He found that the differences in size and shape may have actually been related to the gender and age of the animal. Now only one species is recognized for certain, C. casuarius, although C. intermedius has been recognized as valid in some studies. It is based on specimen ROM <unk>, a skull found by Levi Sternberg in 1920 and was named by William Parks in 1923, who had originally named it <unk> intermedius earlier that year. The specific name of C. intermedius is derived from its apparent intermediate position according to Parks. C. intermedius lived at a slightly later time in the Campanian than C. casuarius, and the two species are not identical, which supported the separation of them in a 2009 study.

It was later known as the Christiana @-@ Elkton Turnpike before becoming Old Baltimore Pike. This path served as a major connection between Philadelphia and Baltimore in addition to providing access between the shipping area of Christiana Bridge and agricultural areas in northern Delaware, northern Maryland, and southeastern Pennsylvania. In 1723, Welsh <unk> settlers pushed for the road to be improved. This road was part of the Washington – <unk> Revolutionary Route that was used by the French army during their march from Newport, Rhode Island to Yorktown during the Revolutionary War, passing through the area in September <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> The road, also known as Old Post Road, was incorporated in 1813 as the Elk and Christiana Turnpike in order to get more money for repairs. The turnpike was completed in April 1817. As a turnpike, tolls were collected to pay for the maintenance of the road. The construction of the New Castle and Frenchtown Railroad lowered the revenues of the turnpike and it became a public road again in 1838. The road historically went through agricultural areas ; however, the surroundings have become more developed over the years. Much of the Old Baltimore Pike remains two lanes.

" Oldham's soils were too thin and poor to sustain crop growing, and so for decades prior to industrialisation the area was used for grazing sheep, which provided the raw material for a local <unk> weaving trade. 
<|endoftext|> By 1756, Oldham had emerged as centre of the <unk> industry in England. The rough felt used in the production process is the origin of the term " <unk> <unk> " a nickname for people from Oldham. It was not until the last quarter of the 18th century that Oldham changed from being a cottage industry township producing <unk> garments via domestic manual labour, to a sprawling industrial metropolis of textile factories. The climate, geology, and topography of Oldham were <unk> constraints upon the social and economic activities of the human inhabitants. At 700 feet ( 213 m ) above sea level and with no major river or visible natural resources, Oldham had poor geographic attributes compared with other settlements for investors and their engineers. As a result, Oldham played no part in the initial period of the Industrial Revolution, although it did later become seen as obvious territory to <unk> because of its convenient position between the labour forces of Manchester and southwest Yorkshire. 
<|endoftext|> Cotton spinning and <unk> were introduced to Oldham when its first mill, Lees Hall, was built by William <unk> in about 1778, the beginning of a <unk> process of <unk> and <unk> transformation. Within a year, 11 other mills had been constructed, and by 1818 there were 19 – not a large number in comparison with other local settlements. Oldham's small local population was greatly increased by the mass migration of workers from outlying villages, resulting in a population increase from just over 12 @,@ 000 in 1801 to 137 @,@ 000 in 1901. The speed of this urban growth meant that Oldham, with little pre @-@ industrial history to speak of, was effectively born as a factory town. 
<|endoftext|> Oldham became the world's manufacturing centre for cotton spinning in the second half of the 19th century. In 1851, over 30 % of Oldham's population was employed within the textile sector, compared to 5 % across Great Britain. It overtook the major urban centres of Manchester and Bolton as the result of a mill building boom in the 1860s and 1870s, a period during which Oldham became the most productive cotton @-@ spinning town in the world. In 1871, Oldham had more spindles than any country in the world except the United States, and in 1909, was spinning more cotton than France and Germany combined. By 1911 there were 16 @.@ 4 million spindles in Oldham, compared with a total of 58 million in the United Kingdom and 143 @.@ 5 million in the world ; in 1928, with the construction of the UK's largest textile factory Oldham reached its manufacturing zenith. At its peak, there were more than 360 mills, operating night and day ; 
<|endoftext|> Oldham's <unk> was dominated by distinctive rectangular brick @-@ built mills. Oldham was hit hard by the Lancashire Cotton Famine of 1861 – 1865, when supplies of raw cotton from the United States were cut off. <unk> reliant upon the textile industry, the cotton famine created chronic unemployment in the town. By 1863 a committee had been formed, and with aid from central government, land was purchased with the intention of employing local cotton workers to construct Alexandra Park, which opened on 28 August 1865. Said to have over @-@ relied upon the textile sector, as the <unk> of cheaper foreign <unk> grew during the 20th century, Oldham's economy declined into a depression, although it was not until 1964 that Oldham ceased to be the largest centre of cotton spinning. In spite of efforts to increase the efficiency and competitiveness of its production, the last cotton spun in the town was in 1998.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The development of women's football in Africa faces several challenges, including limited access to education, poverty amongst women, <unk> and human rights abuses targeting women. Funding is another issue impacting the game in Africa, where most financial assistance comes from FIFA and not national football associations. Another challenge is the retention of football players. Many women footballers leave the continent to seek greater opportunity in Europe or the United States. 
<|endoftext|> Gambia's national football association was founded in 1952, and became affiliated with FIFA in 1968. Football is the most popular women's sport in the country, and was first played in an organized system in 1998. A national competition was launched in 2007, the same year FIFA started an education course on football for women. Competition was active on both the national and scholastic levels by 2009. There are four staffers dedicated to women's football in the Gambia Football Association, and representation of women on the board is required by the association's charter.

<|endoftext|> Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long <unk> from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène <unk> and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large @-@ scale studies in all the major keys ( Op. 35 ) and all the minor keys ( Op. 39 ). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano ( Op. 39, nos. 4 – 7 ) and Concerto for Solo Piano ( Op. 39, nos. 8 – 10 ), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self @-@ imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. 
<|endoftext|> Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. <unk> in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son <unk> @-@ Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. 
<|endoftext|> Following his death ( which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase ) Alkan's music became neglected, supported by only a few musicians including <unk> Busoni, Egon Petri and <unk> Sorabji.

For centuries, peasant farmers of the area would occasionally capture the horses and use them for agricultural work, including <unk> grain and herding bulls. 
<|endoftext|> In the 1920s and 1930s, as mechanization became more prevalent, both wild and domesticated breeding stock diminished to almost nothing, and d 'Andrade, along with his son Fernando, encouraged the conservation of the breed. In 1937, d 'Andrade began a small herd of his own with five stallions and seven mares from horses obtained near <unk>, Portugal. All <unk> currently in captivity descend from these original horses obtained by d 'Andrade, and it is believed that the remnant wild herds of the breed died out soon after. These horses were kept in a habitat similar to their native one. In 1975, two other farms took up the Sorraia's cause and acquired small herds to help with conservation. In 1976, three stallions and three mares were imported to Germany from Portugal to begin a sub @-@ population there. In March 2004, a small breeding herd of Sorraia horses was released on the estate of a private land owner who dedicated a portion of his property so that these horses could live completely wild, as did their ancestors. The refuge created for them is in the Vale de <unk> region of south western Portugal, one of places so named because this is where the Sorraia's predecessors dwelt.

<|endoftext|> Marlborough joined the group of battleships battering the German light cruiser SMS Wiesbaden at 18 : 25. She fired five salvos, before a premature detonation in the right barrel of " A " turret disabled the gun. She also engaged the ship with her secondary battery. At 18 : 39, Marlborough again engaged what appeared to be a Kaiser @-@ class ship, firing a salvo before the German vessel disappeared into the haze. During the engagement with Wiesbaden, the German cruiser launched one or two torpedoes at around 18 : 45, one of which struck Marlborough around the starboard diesel generator room. The detonation tore a 28 @-@ foot ( 8 @.@ 5 m ) hole in the hull and causing significant flooding, that forced the forward boilers on that side of the ship to be <unk> and reduced the ship's speed to 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ).

She fired thirteen salvos in the span of six minutes at SMS Grosser Kurfürst at ranges of 10 @,@ 200 to 10 @,@ 750 yards ( 9 @,@ 330 to 9 @,@ 830 m ), scoring three hits, though she incorrectly claimed a fourth hit. During this phase of the battle, Marlborough fired two torpedoes, both of which missed their targets : the first at Wiesbaden at 19 : 10 and the second at SMS Kaiser at 19 : 25. 
<|endoftext|> By about 19 : 30, Marlborough's pumps had contained the flooding in the boiler rooms but she took on a list of around 7 – 8 degrees. Instead of using counter @-@ flooding to minimise the list, her crew attempted to correct the list by using coal and oil from the starboard bunkers first. The list caused the generators supplying power to the main battery turrets to flood, hampering the gun crews, particularly as shells were transferred from the magazines to the turrets. The blast from the torpedo was so powerful that forty <unk> compartments were damaged, though the torpedo bulkhead localised most of the damage and the more badly damaged compartments were sufficiently <unk> up. Three more torpedoes approached Marlborough at 19 : 33. She <unk> the first two and the third <unk> passed under the ship.

By around 02 : 00 on 1 June, the 6th Division was about 12 nmi ( 22 km ; 14 mi ) behind the rest of the fleet. At that time, the bulkheads in the starboard forward boiler room started to give way under the strain, forcing Marlborough to reduce speed to 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ). The damage control teams believed that if the main battery were to fire, the shoring supporting the damaged bulkheads would give way, greatly increasing the risk to the ship. Jellicoe detached the ship to proceed independently to Rosyth or the <unk> ; Burney had ordered the scout cruiser Fearless to come alongside to transfer him to the battleship Revenge. Marlborough thereafter proceeded northward at a speed of 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ).

<|endoftext|> With Benson's help, Walpole had come to terms with the loss of his faith. Somerset Walpole, himself the son of an Anglican priest, hoped that his eldest son would follow him into the ministry. Walpole was too concerned for his father's feelings to tell him he was no longer a believer, and on graduation from Cambridge in 1906 he took a post as a lay <unk> at the <unk> Mission to Seamen in Liverpool. He described that as one of the " greatest failures of my life...

It was as an author that Walpole felt <unk> to make his career. He moved to London and found work as a book reviewer for The Standard, writing fiction in his spare time. He had by this time recognised <unk> that he was homosexual. His encounters were necessarily discreet, as such activities were illegal in Britain, and remained so throughout his lifetime.

The book received good reviews but barely repaid the cost of having it <unk>. His first commercial success was Mr Perrin and Mr Traill, published in 1911. The novelist and biographer Michael Sadleir writes that though some of the six novels Walpole wrote between 1909 and 1914 are of interest as examples of the author's developing style, it is Mr Perrin and Mr Traill that deserves to be remembered for its own sake. The book, <unk> " a <unk> @-@ comedy ", is a psychological study of a deadly clash between two <unk>, one an ageing failure and the other a young, attractive idealist. In the view of Hart @-@ Davis, Walpole only once recaptured " the fresh, clear cut realism " of this book, and Walpole himself, looking back on his work in the 1930s, felt that of all his books to date, it was the <unk>. The Observer gave the book a favourable review : " The slow growth of the poison within [ Perrin ] is traced with wonderful skill and sympathy... one feels throughout these pages a sense of intolerable tension, of impending disaster " ; The Manchester Guardian was less enthusiastic, praising the scene @-@ setting but calling the story " an <unk> melodrama ". The San Francisco Chronicle praised its " technical excellence, imagination and beauty – Walpole at his best.

<|endoftext|> low pressure area on September 23 after the northern portion of the wave broke off and crossed the Yucatán Peninsula. Initially, a Hurricane Hunters flight was scheduled to investigate the system, although the low became disorganized over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico due to high wind shear. However, the wind shear decreased, and late on September 25, another Hurricane Hunters flight indicated the development of a closed low @-@ level circulation. Based on that observation, along with sufficient persistence of the thunderstorms, the system developed into Tropical Depression Thirteen about 190 mi ( 305 km ) east of Tampico, Tamaulipas. 
<|endoftext|> Upon developing, the depression was located in an area of weak steering currents, resulting in an erratic movement generally to the south. In its formative stages, the depression executed a small loop. As it did so, it moved into an area of very warm waters and decreasing wind shear. The depression's convection gradually organized, although the winds were slower to increase. An anticyclone became established over the system, and the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Lorenzo at around 1200 UTC on September 27. At the time, it was located about 150 mi ( 240 km ) east of Tuxpan, Veracruz, moving steadily westward under the influence of a building ridge to its east. As it approached the coast, Lorenzo rapidly intensified unexpectedly, and within 12 hours of attaining tropical storm status it strengthened into a hurricane. 
<|endoftext|> Hurricane Lorenzo quickly developed a closed eyewall, which was observed on radar and provided a peak intensity estimate of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) at 0000 UTC on September 28. The cyclone maintained vigorous and <unk> convection across the center, although the structure deteriorated slightly before Lorenzo crossed the coast near Tecolutla, Veracruz at <unk> UTC that day, with winds estimated around 75 mph ( 120 km / h ). After making landfall, the hurricane rapidly weakened to tropical depression intensity. <unk> inland, the circulation became difficult to locate as the convection diminished to rainbands along the coast.

Mexico's Civilian Protection officials declared a " red alert " for much of the state of Veracruz. Along the coast of Veracruz, officials canceled school classes. Officials opened 315 shelters in Veracruz, along with six in neighboring Hidalgo, which housed 45 @,@ 164 people during the storm. The government of Veracruz provided buses for people to transport from their houses to the shelters. Ports in Tecolutla, Tuxpan and Nautla were forced to close. Lorenzo's formation caused gas prices to rise due to its potential to disrupt oil facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. 
<|endoftext|> Hurricane Lorenzo made landfall in Veracruz, the same region of east @-@ central Mexico as Hurricane Dean did one month prior. The hurricane primarily affected small fishing villages along the coast, where strong winds knocked down power lines, leaving about 85 @,@ 000 people without electricity. To prevent the danger of fallen wires, officials shut off the power grid in several municipalities in northern Veracruz. The winds also destroyed the roofs of several houses in Nautla. In addition to the high winds, Lorenzo dropped heavy rainfall along the coast and further inland, peaking at 12 @.@ 83 in ( 326 mm ) in El <unk>, Veracruz. The rains caused flash flooding and mudslides that killed at least four people, including a family of three in Puebla state. <unk> also closed portions of three highways. In some locations, <unk> reached about 1 foot ( 300 mm ) in depth.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Taylor summoned Khánh to his office, but the Vietnamese leader sent Thi, Kỳ, Thiệu and Admiral Chung Tấn Cang, the commander of the Republic of Vietnam Navy, instead. Taylor asked the four to sit down and then said " Do all of you understand English? " The ambassador then angrily denounced the officers. According to Stanley Karnow, Taylor " launched into a <unk>, scolding them as if he were still superintendent of West Point and they a group of cadets caught cheating ". He said " I told you all clearly at General Westmoreland's dinner we Americans were tired of coups. Apparently I wasted my words. " He decried the removal of the HNC as " totally illegal ", and said it had " destroyed the government @-@ making process ", and that " I made it clear that all the military plans I know you would like to carry out are dependent on government stability ", something he felt had been lost with the dismissal of the HNC. He said "... you have made a real mess. We cannot carry you forever if you do things like this. " Taylor believed the HNC to be an essential part of the government, because as an American, he believed civilian legitimacy was a must. For him, the HNC was a necessary step in a progression towards an elected civilian legislature, which he regarded as critical for national and military morale. The historian Mark <unk> regarded Taylor's intervention as unnecessary, and noted that there had been many instances of fierce fighting in Vietnamese history despite the complete absence of democracy throughout the nation's history. Taylor also reminded them of an earlier meeting where he had discussed an American plan to expand the war, increase funding for the South Vietnamese military, and to go on the offensive against the communists at the request of Khánh. Taylor said the Americans would not be able to help Saigon pursue their desired military strategy if the political machinations did not stop. Taylor said that if the military did not transfer some powers or advisory capacity back to the HNC or another civilian institution, aid would be withheld, and some planned military operations against the Ho Chi Minh trail — which was being used to infiltrate communists into the south — would be suspended. 
<|endoftext|> The four officers were taken aback by Taylor's searing words and felt they had been humiliated. A decade after the incident, Kỳ described Taylor as " the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them ", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said " For the sake of their own pride, they [ the Vietnamese officers ] resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into'getting things done ', <unk> like a viceroy? " However, Thi also took a <unk> pleasure in <unk> Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, <unk>. When asked why he was happy, Thi said " Because this is one of the <unk> days of my life... Today I told the American ambassador that he could not <unk> to us. " Nevertheless, Taylor's conduct had rankled the officers, stirring their latent sense of nationalism and anti @-@ Americanism ; Khánh would exploit this to strengthen his fragile position in the junta. 
<|endoftext|> Khánh's quartet of delegates responded to Taylor in a <unk> way. They remained calm and did not resort to direct confrontation. Kỳ said the change was necessary, as " the political situation is worse than it ever was under Diệm ". Kỳ explained that the situation mandated the dissolution of the council, saying " We know you want stability, but you cannot have stability until you have Unity. " He claimed some HNC members were <unk> coup rumors and creating doubt among the population, and that " both military and civilian leaders regard the presence of these people in the High National Council as divisive of the Armed Forces due to their influence ". Kỳ further accused some of the HNC members of being communist sympathizers and <unk> who wanted to stop the military from strengthening. He promised to explain the decision

The eggs are laid at daily intervals, but second clutches may sometimes have two eggs added per day. Incubation is by the female only ; her tendency to sit tight when disturbed, or wait until the last moment to flee, leads to many deaths during hay @-@ cutting and harvesting. The eggs hatch together after 19 – 20 days, and the precocial chicks leave the nest within a day or two. They are fed by the female for three or four days, but can find their own food thereafter. The juveniles fledge after 34 – 38 days. The second brood is started about 42 days after the first, and the incubation period is slightly shorter at 16 – 18 days. The grown young may stay with the female until departure for Africa. 
<|endoftext|> Nest success in undisturbed sites is high, at 80 – 90 %, but much lower in fertilised meadows and on arable land. The method and timing of mowing is crucial ; mechanized mowing can kill 38 – 95 % of chicks in a given site, and losses average 50 % of first brood chicks and somewhat less than 40 % of second brood chicks. The influence of weather on chick survival is limited ; although chick growth is faster in dry or warm weather, the effects are relatively small. Unlike many precocial species, chicks are fed by their mother to a greater or lesser extent until they become independent, and this may cushion them from adverse conditions. The number of live chicks hatched is more important than the weather, with lower survival in large broods. The annual adult survival rate is under 30 %, although some individuals may live for 5 – 7 years.

Donaldson thought Giger was the best man for the film after reading his compendium <unk>, and eventually he and Mancuso flew to Switzerland to meet the artist. What attracted Giger was the opportunity to design " a monster in another way — an aesthetic warrior, also sensual and deadly, like the women look in [ his ] paintings. " While Giger opted to stay in Switzerland to take care of his dying mother instead of flying to Los Angeles to accompany production, he built some puppets in his own studio, and later <unk> sketches and <unk> paintings as production went through. The practical models were made by Steve Johnson and his company XFX, which had already worked with Giger's designs in <unk> II. Giger had envisioned more stages of Sil's transformation, but the film only employed the last one, where she is " transparent outside and black inside — like a glass body but with carbon inside, " with XFX doing the translucent skin based on what they had done for the aliens of The Abyss. Sil's alien form had both full @-@ body <unk> with <unk> arms, heads and torsos, and a body suit. Richard <unk>'s Boss Film Studios was hired for over 50 shots of computer @-@ generated imagery, which included one of the earliest forms of motion capture effects. Using a two @-@ foot @-@ high ( 60 cm ) electric puppet that had sensors translating its movements to a digital Sil, Boss Films managed to achieve in one day what would have once taken as much as three weeks with practical effects. 
<|endoftext|> Giger was unhappy with some elements he found to bear similarity with other movies, particularly the Alien franchise. At one point he sent a <unk> to Mancuso finding five similarities : a " <unk> " ( as Sil giving birth echoed the infant Alien breaking out of its host's chest ), the creature having a punching tongue ( Giger at first wanted Sil's tongue to be composed of barbed hooks ), a cocoon, the use of flame throwers, and having Giger as the creature designer. A great point of contention was the ending, which Giger considered derivative from the <unk> from both Alien 3 and Terminator 2 : Judgment Day. The designer felt that horror films frequently held some final confrontation with fire, which he considered old @-@ fashioned and linked to medieval witch trials. He sent some ideas for the climax to the producers, with them accepting to have Sil's ultimate death occurring by <unk>.

It was ruled by the extreme nationalist Ustaša regime. The Ustaša quickly started with the systematic persecution of the Jews, modeled after the Nazi Germany approach, and at times even more brutal. Racial laws were introduced, Jewish property was confiscated, and the Jews were subjected to mass arrests and <unk> to death camps in Croatia and abroad. 
<|endoftext|> In October 1941, the newly installed mayor of Zagreb, Ivan Werner, issued a decree ordering the demolition of the Praška Street synagogue, ostensibly because it did not fit into the city's master plan. The demolition began on October 10, 1941, proceeding slowly so as not to damage the adjacent buildings ; it was finished by April 1942. The whole process was photographed for propaganda purposes, and the photographs were shown to the public at an antisemitic exhibition first held in Zagreb. It was also shown in Dubrovnik, <unk>, Sarajevo, Vukovar and <unk>, as an illustration of the " solution of the Jewish question in Croatia ". 
<|endoftext|> A fragment of the film footage of the demolition was discovered five decades later by the film director <unk> <unk> during research for his 1993 documentary feature, Decline of the Century : <unk> of L.

<|endoftext|> The synagogue's eight valuable Torah scrolls were saved due to an intervention by Leonardo Grivičić, an entrepreneur and industrialist who lived next door from Mile <unk>, a minister in the Ustaša government. He was also close to <unk> Ante Pavelić and the Third Reich's ambassador to Croatia, Edmund <unk> @-@ <unk>. Although Grivičić did not have a significant political role in the Independent State of Croatia, he was considered trustworthy. On October 9, 1941, he learned about the regime's plan to start the demolition of the synagogue on the following morning. By that evening, Grivičić secretly relayed the information to the synagogue's chief cantor, <unk>, and during the night, the Torah scrolls were moved to safety. 
<|endoftext|> Shortly after the destruction of the synagogue, the Catholic archbishop of Zagreb <unk> <unk> delivered a <unk> in which he said : " A house of God of any faith is a holy thing, and whoever harms it will pay with their lives. In this world and the next they will be punished. ".

She first appeared on television in the Tracey Ullman Show short " Good Night " on April 19, 1987. Maggie was created and designed by cartoonist Matt Groening while he was waiting in the lobby of James L. Brooks'office. She received her first name from Groening's youngest sister. After appearing on The Tracey Ullman Show for three years, the Simpson family was given their own series on the Fox Broadcasting Company which debuted December 17, 1989. 
<|endoftext|> Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. She is often seen sucking on her red pacifier and, when she walks, she trips over her clothing and falls on her face ( this running gag is used much more in earlier seasons ). Being an infant, she cannot talk. She is a counterpart to Lisa Simpson. However, she did appear to talk in the first Tracy Ullman short. Therefore, she is the least seen and heard member of the Simpson family. 
<|endoftext|> Maggie's <unk> and occasional speaking parts are currently provided by Nancy Cartwright, but she has also been voiced by guest stars James Earl Jones, Elizabeth Taylor and <unk> Foster, and by series regulars <unk> Smith and Harry Shearer.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not physically age, and as such the show is assumed to be set in the current year. In several episodes, events have been linked to specific times, though sometimes this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Maggie is the youngest child of Marge and Homer, and sister to Bart and Lisa. When Marge became pregnant with Bart, she and Homer got married at a chapel in Las Vegas. To support his impending family, Homer all but demanded a job at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, impressing its owner, Mr Burns, with his aggressive <unk>. When Marge became pregnant with Lisa, two years later, she and Homer bought their first house. Another six years later, Homer felt financially secure enough to finally quit his job at the Power Plant and take his dream job at Barney's <unk>.

It also contains a crossover with Swamp Thing, where Constantine loses his body while the Swamp Thing uses it to <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> This was followed by a lengthy nine @-@ issue story arc, " The Fear Machine ", revolving around a <unk> plot to collect people's fears, in order to resurrect a <unk> god known as <unk>, and his efforts to prevent this with the help of environmentalists, including Mercury, a young psychic girl, and <unk>, her mother, with whom he becomes romantically involved. The penultimate major run of Delano's tenure was " The Family Man ", which differed from the main body of the series thus far in that Constantine's nemesis is not supernatural ( beyond an opening <unk> encounter with a fictional fence ), but a former policeman turned serial killer. John's ethical quandary as to whether murder is ever acceptable, and his <unk> with the murder of his father, Thomas, frames this story. During this run on the title, Grant Morrison ( issues # 25 & 26 ) and Neil Gaiman ( issue # 27 ) both filled in during a three @-@ month break, Grant Morrison's story dealing with nuclear fear, and Neil Gaiman's being a simple romantic ghost story.

It also had a strong religious theme, with John's dealings with the First of the Fallen, and some storylines, such as the relationship between an angel, <unk>, and a <unk> demon, Ellie, would go on to be used again as a major plot device in Preacher, one of his most popular works. He also references the music of The <unk> and the poetry of Brendan <unk>, both of these being relevant to Ennis'Irish heritage.

In the course of trying to save himself, he visits Ireland, where he becomes <unk> with Kit Ryan, an old friend. The following few issues follow the early stages of his relationship with Kit, a plot to install a demon on the British throne in the plotline " Royal Blood ", and in the extended issue # 50, his first meeting with the King of the <unk>.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The changes in water flow and use caused by Hoover Dam's construction and operation have had a large impact on the Colorado River Delta. The construction of the dam has been credited as causing the decline of this estuarine ecosystem. For six years after the construction of the dam, while Lake Mead filled, virtually no water reached the mouth of the river. The delta's estuary, which once had a freshwater @-@ <unk> mixing zone stretching 40 miles ( 64 km ) south of the river's mouth, was turned into an <unk> estuary where the level of salinity was higher close to the river's mouth. 
<|endoftext|> The Colorado River had experienced natural flooding before the construction of the Hoover Dam. The dam eliminated the natural flooding, which threatened many species adapted to the flooding, including both plants and animals. The construction of the dam devastated the populations of native fish in the river downstream from the dam. Four species of fish native to the Colorado River, the <unk> <unk>, Colorado <unk>, <unk> <unk>, and Razorback <unk>, are listed as endangered. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Naming controversy = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> During the years of lobbying leading up to the passage of legislation authorizing the dam in 1928, the press generally referred to the dam as " Boulder Dam " or as " Boulder Canyon Dam ", even though the proposed site had shifted to Black Canyon. The Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 ( <unk> ) never mentioned a proposed name or title for the dam. The <unk> merely allows the government to " construct, operate, and maintain a dam and incidental works in the main stream of the Colorado River at Black Canyon or Boulder Canyon ". 
<|endoftext|> When Secretary Wilbur spoke at the ceremony starting the building of the railway between Las Vegas and the dam site on September 17, 1930, he named the dam " Hoover Dam ", citing a tradition of naming dams after Presidents, though none had been so honored during their terms of office. Wilbur justified his choice on the ground that Hoover was " the great engineer whose vision and persistence... has done so much to make [ the dam ] possible ". One writer complained in response that " the Great Engineer had quickly drained, <unk>, and <unk> the country. " 
<|endoftext|> After Hoover's election defeat in 1932 and the accession of the Roosevelt administration, Secretary Ickes ordered on May 13, 1933 that the dam be referred to as " Boulder Dam ". Ickes stated that Wilbur had been <unk> in naming the dam after a sitting president, that Congress had never ratified his choice, and that it had long been referred to as Boulder Dam. Unknown to the general public, Attorney General Homer Cummings informed Ickes that Congress had indeed used the name " Hoover Dam " in five different bills appropriating money for construction of the dam. The official status this conferred to the name " Hoover Dam " had been noted on the floor of the House of Representatives by Congressman Edward T. Taylor of Colorado on December 12, 1930, but was likewise ignored by Ickes. 
<|endoftext|> When Ickes spoke at the dedication ceremony on September 30, 1935, he was determined, as he recorded in his diary, " to try to nail down for good and all the name Boulder Dam. " At one point in the speech, he spoke the words " Boulder Dam " five times within thirty seconds. Further, he suggested that if the dam were to be named after any one person, it should be for California Senator <unk> Johnson, a lead sponsor of the authorizing legislation. Roosevelt also referred to the dam as Boulder Dam, and the Republican @-@ leaning Los Angeles Times, which at the time of Ickes'name change had run an editorial cartoon showing Ickes <unk> <unk> away at an enormous sign " <unk> <unk>, " <unk> it showing Roosevelt reinforcing Ickes, but having no greater success. 
<|endoftext|> In the following years, the name " Boulder Dam " failed to fully take hold, with many Americans using both names <unk> and <unk> divided as to which name should be printed. Memories of the Great Depression faded, and Hoover to some extent rehabilitated himself through good works during and after World War II. In 1947, a bill passed both Houses of Congress unanimously restoring the name " Hoover Dam. " Ickes, who was by then a private citizen, opposed the change, stating, " I didn 't know Hoover was that small a man to take credit for something he had nothing to do with. "

Designed by Catalan artist <unk> Plensa and executed by Krueck and Sexton Architects, it opened in July 2004. The fountain is composed of a black granite reflecting pool placed between a pair of glass brick towers. The towers are 50 feet ( 15 @.@ 2 m ) tall, and they use light @-@ emitting diodes ( LEDs ) to display digital videos on their inward faces. Construction and design of the Crown Fountain cost $ 17 million. The water operates from May to October, intermittently cascading down the two towers and spouting through a nozzle on each tower's front face. 
<|endoftext|> Residents and critics have praised the fountain for its artistic and entertainment features. It highlights Plensa's themes of dualism, light, and water, extending the use of video technology from his prior works. Its use of water is unique among Chicago's many fountains, in that it promotes physical interaction between the public and the water. Both the fountain and Millennium Park are highly accessible because of their universal design. 
<|endoftext|> Crown Fountain has been one of the most controversial of all the Millennium Park features. Before it was even built, some were concerned that the sculpture's height violated the aesthetic tradition of the park. After construction, surveillance cameras were installed atop the fountain, which led to a public <unk> ( and their quick removal ). 
<|endoftext|> However, the fountain has survived its contentious beginnings to find its way into Chicago pop culture. It is a popular subject for photographers and a common gathering place.

On 12 February 1813 Beer received the first of the string of honours he was to accumulate throughout his life when he was appointed'Court Composer'by Grand Duke Ludwig of <unk> @-@ <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Throughout his early career, although determined to become a musician, Beer found it difficult to decide between playing and composition. Certainly other professionals in the decade 1810 – 1820, including Moscheles, considered him amongst the greatest <unk> of his period. He wrote during this period numerous piano pieces, including a concerto and set of variations for piano and orchestra, but these have been lost. To this period also belongs a <unk> <unk> written for the virtuoso Heinrich <unk> ( 1784 – 1847 ) who remained a close friend of the composer.

In the same year, his opera Die <unk> <unk> ( The Two <unk> ), a version of Wirth und <unk>, was a disastrous failure in Vienna. Realizing that a full understanding of Italian opera was essential for his musical development, he went to study in Italy, enabled by the financial support of his family. He arrived in Italy at the beginning of 1816, after visits to Paris and London, where he heard Cramer play. In Paris, he wrote to a friend,'I go from museum to museum, library to library, theatre to theatre, with the restlessness of the <unk> Jew '.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The Feast of the Goat's major themes include political corruption, machismo, memory, and writing and power. Olga Lorenzo, reviewer for The Melbourne Age, suggests that overall Vargas Llosa's aim is to reveal the irrational forces of Latin tradition that give rise to <unk>. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Political corruption = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The structure of Dominican society was hierarchical, with strongly gendered roles. Rafael Trujillo, the ruler, was a cruel dictator who haunts the people of Santo Domingo even 35 years after his death. He is a true <unk>, ruling with brutality and corruption. He creates a personality cult in his capitalist society and encourages <unk> within his regime. Prior to promotion to a position of responsibility, an officer is required to pass a " test of loyalty ". His people are to remain loyal to him all cost, and are periodically tested by public humiliation and <unk> even though acts of <unk> were rare. Trujillo <unk> women and children as an expression of political and sexual power, and in some cases takes the wife or child of his lieutenants, many of whom still remain <unk> loyal. Even the church and military institutions are employed to give women to the <unk> for pleasure. 
<|endoftext|> Many of the assassins had belonged to the Trujillo regime or had at one point been its staunch supporters, only to find their support for him eroded by the state's crimes against its people. Imbert, one of the assassins, sums up this realization in a comment prompted by the murder of the Mirabal sisters : " They kill our fathers, our brothers, our friends. And now they're killing our women. And here we sit, resigned, waiting our turn. " In an interview, Vargas Llosa describes the corruption and brutality of Trujillo's regime : " He had more or less all the common traits of a Latin American dictator, but pushed to the extreme. In cruelty, I think he went far far away from the rest — and in corruption, too. " 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = <unk> = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> According to literary scholar Peter Anthony <unk>, the two important components of machismo are aggressive behaviour and hyper @-@ sexuality. <unk> behaviour is exhibited by displays of power and strength, while hyper @-@ sexuality is revealed through sexual activity with as many partners as possible. These two components shape the portrayal of Trujillo and his regime in The Feast of the Goat. As Lorenzo observes, Vargas Llosa " reveals traditions of machismo, of abusive fathers, and of child @-@ rearing practices that repeat the <unk> of children, so that each generation <unk> a withering of the soul to the subsequent one. " 
<|endoftext|> In a display of both aspects of machismo, Trujillo demanded of his aides and cabinet that they provide him with sexual access to their wives and daughters. Mario Vargas Llosa wrote of Trujillo's machismo and treatment of women, " [ h ] e went to bed with his ministers'wives, not only because he liked these ladies but because it was a way to test his ministers. He wanted to know if they were ready to accept this extreme humiliation. <unk> the ministers were prepared to play this grotesque role — and they remained loyal to Trujillo even after his death. " Trujillo's sexual conquests and public <unk> of his enemies also serve to affirm his political power and machismo. In <unk>'s words, " The implication is that maximum <unk> equals political dominance. " 
<|endoftext|> Trujillo's attempted sexual conquest of Urania is an example of both political manipulation of Agustín Cabral and sexual power over young women. However, as Trujillo's penis remains flaccid throughout the encounter and he is humiliated in front of the young girl, the encounter fails to satisfy his requirements for machismo.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In September 1994, Looking Glass Technologies employee Seamus Blackley told Computer Gaming World that he wanted to create a combat @-@ based sequel to Flight Unlimited, whose development he was directing at the time. The magazine's Johnny L. Wilson wrote, " If Flight Unlimited can pass the civilian tests, the military version should be right behind it. " In March of the next year, Blackley told PC Gamer US that the sequel " should feel so real that pilots will be afraid. They 'll feel the gun hits. " He dismissed the flight dynamics in other flight simulators, such as Falcon 3 @.@ 0, in favor of the real @-@ time computational fluid dynamics ( <unk> ) model he created for Flight Unlimited. When PC Gamer's Bernie <unk> asked why the team had waited to make a combat flight simulator, Blackley responded that they wanted to " <unk> " players first. In September, Computer Gaming World reported that Blackley was designing a combat @-@ based sequel to Flight Unlimited under the working title Flight Combat. Blackley told them that it would " make you into a fighter pilot ", and the magazine commented that it would teach the same material as the Air Force. The team planned to allow players to practice an element and then execute it on a mission, and Blackley said that the game would feature competitive online play. However, a new manager at Looking Glass Technologies, instated by venture capital investors, demanded that Blackley work on Flight Unlimited II instead of Flight Combat. Blackley refused and was fired, leaving the company in late 1995. 
<|endoftext|> In March 1996, PC Gamer US reported that Flight Combat was " still taxiing across the design board ", and that the team planned to focus " on how the aerial manoeuvres are performed as you fight ". Looking Glass designer Constantine Hantzopoulos told the magazine that a modified version of the Flight Unlimited engine was being used to develop Flight Combat and Flight Unlimited II. Hantzopoulos commented that Flight Combat was " the project everybody at Looking Glass wants to work on ". The team expected to be finished with the game in roughly one year. By June 1997, GameSpot reported that Flight Unlimited II was running on the new <unk> engine, coded from scratch by programmer James Fleming. In addition, the real @-@ time <unk> model from Flight Unlimited had been discarded, as its programming was " all black box <unk> code from Seamus ". GameSpot's T. Liam MacDonald noted that the Flight Unlimited II team expected soon to use the same engine for a combat flight simulator set in World War II. Computer Gaming World similarly reported that the company was " definitely hot " to develop Flight Combat, and that it might be created after Flight Unlimited II. Following that game's completion, the team could not decide between developing Flight Unlimited III or Flight Combat. As a result, they decided to develop them simultaneously, and Flight Combat began production in early 1998. Unlike all of the studio's other games, development of Flight Combat was funded through an insured bond, in an attempt to guarantee that the game would be finished. The company's Tim <unk> later said that this setup was " a real pain for [ the team ] in some ways ".

In the last season of the decade 32 performances were given in Cardiff and 61 elsewhere in the UK. In addition to the main company, WNO maintained two smaller groups : one, with orchestra, toured Welsh towns, the other, consisting of 12 singers with piano, toured 79, mostly small, towns in Wales and England. WNO instituted its own training scheme for young singers during the decade. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Fully professional : 1970s = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In 1970 WNO stopped using the Bournemouth and other orchestras and established its own, known at first as the Welsh <unk>. Three years later the last amateur element of the company was removed when the chorus became fully professional. A further broadening of the repertoire took place in the 1970s : in 1971 WNO staged the first performances in Britain of Berg's Lulu, directed by Michael Geliot, who had succeeded Moody in 1969. In the view of Malcolm Boyd in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, Geliot, " unpredictable and often controversial ", largely shaped the company's style in the 1970s. In collaboration with the company's musical director James Lockhart, Geliot is credited by The Times with introducing new young singers and " directing a host of groundbreaking productions " before leaving in 1978. The critic Rodney <unk> wrote in 1975 about WNO's productions : 
<|endoftext|> I have never seen, well, hardly ever, a pretentious, silly or seriously <unk> production, and neither have I seen a dull one. … The company's greatest virtue is that its work is dedicated above all to the service of composers and audiences, and not to some abstract notion of " prestige " nor to the vanity or ambition of individuals, and in this it is almost unique. 
<|endoftext|> In 1973 Geliot's WNO staging of <unk>'s Billy <unk> with Allen in the title role was presented on a Swiss tour, and two years later it was given in Barcelona. The company returned to London with its participation in the <unk> Festival of Opera at the Dominion Theatre in 1979, presenting The Makropoulos Case, The Magic <unk>, <unk>, Madame Butterfly, and Tristan and Isolde to capacity audiences.

Das <unk>, Siegfried and <unk> were conducted by the company's musical director, Richard Armstrong ; Die <unk> ( 1984 ) was conducted by Goodall ; it was seen as a coup for the company to secure his services – he was described by The Guardian as the greatest living <unk> conductor – but the casting of the whole cycle was criticised for some serious weaknesses among the principal singers, and reviewers were generally unimpressed by <unk> <unk>'s production.

He was the youngest son of Erard II of Brienne, a wealthy nobleman in Champagne. John, originally destined for an ecclesiastical career, became a knight and owned small estates in Champagne around 1200. After the death of his brother, Walter III, he ruled the County of Brienne on behalf of his minor nephew Walter IV ( who lived in southern Italy ). 
<|endoftext|> The barons of the Kingdom of Jerusalem proposed that John marry Maria, Queen of Jerusalem. With the consent of Philip II of France and Pope Innocent III, he left France for the Holy Land and married the queen ; the royal couple were crowned in 1210. After Maria's death in 1212 John administered the kingdom as regent for their infant daughter, Isabella II ; an influential lord, John of Ibelin, attempted to <unk> him. John was a leader of the Fifth Crusade. Although his claim of supreme command of the crusader army was never unanimously acknowledged, his right to rule Damietta ( in Egypt ) was confirmed shortly after the town fell to the crusaders in 1219. He claimed the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia on behalf of his second wife, Stephanie of Armenia, in 1220. After Stephanie and their infant son died that year, John returned to Egypt. The Fifth Crusade ended in failure ( including the recovery of Damietta by the Egyptians ) in 1221. 
<|endoftext|> John was the first king of Jerusalem to visit Europe ( Italy, France, England, León, Castile and Germany ) to seek assistance for the Holy Land. He gave his daughter in marriage to Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II in 1225, and Frederick ended John's rule of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Although the <unk> tried to persuade Frederick to restore the kingdom to John, the Jerusalemite barons regarded Frederick as their lawful ruler. John administered papal domains in <unk>, became the <unk> of Perugia and was a commander of Pope Gregory IX's army during Gregory's war against Frederick in 1228 and 1229. 
<|endoftext|> He was elected emperor in 1229 as the senior co @-@ ruler ( with Baldwin II ) of the Latin Empire, and was crowned in Constantinople in 1231.

<|endoftext|> The battle took a large enough toll on the British forces that they did not further pursue the main American army. The many American prisoners were sent to Ticonderoga while most of the British troops made their way to Skenesboro to rejoin Burgoyne's army.

On July 5, General Arthur St. Clair's American forces defending Fort Ticonderoga and its supporting defenses discovered that Burgoyne's men had placed cannons on a position overlooking the fort. They evacuated the fort that night, with the majority of the army marching down a rough road ( now referred to locally as the 1776 Hubbardton Military Road ) toward Hubbardton in the disputed New Hampshire Grants territory.

Burgoyne ordered Riedesel to follow ; he set out with a few companies of Brunswick <unk> and grenadiers, leaving orders for the rest of his troops to come as rapidly as possible. Fraser's advance corps was only a few miles behind Colonel <unk> Francis'11th Massachusetts Regiment, which acted as St. Clair's rear guard. 
<|endoftext|> American general St. Clair paused at Hubbardton to give the main army's tired and hungry troops time to rest while he hoped the rear guard would arrive. When it did not arrive in time, he left Colonel Seth Warner and the Green Mountain Boys behind, along with the 2nd New Hampshire Regiment under Colonel Nathan Hale, at Hubbardton to wait for the rear while the main army marched on to Castleton. When Francis'and Hale's men arrived, Warner decided, against St. Clair's orders, that they would spend the night there, rather than marching on to Castleton. Warner, who had experience in rear @-@ guard actions while serving in the invasion of Quebec, arranged the camps in a defensive position on Monument Hill, and set patrols to guard the road to Ticonderoga. 
<|endoftext|> Baron Riedesel caught up with Fraser around 4 pm, and insisted that his men could not go further before making camp. Fraser, who <unk> to this as Riedesel was senior to him in the chain of command, pointed out that he was authorized to engage the enemy, and would be leaving his camp at 3 am the next morning. He then advanced until he found a site about three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from Hubbardton, where his troops camped for the night.

A messenger had arrived from General St. Clair delivering news that the British had reached Skenesboro, where the elements of the retreating army had planned to regroup, and that a more <unk> route to the Hudson River was now required.

<|endoftext|> Born in West Germany, Wever moved to the United States as a child, where he took up baseball. He played baseball in high school and the University of California, Santa Barbara, which led to him being drafted by the New York Yankees. After four seasons in the minor leagues, Wever made his major league debut on 17 September 1982. In his debut, he suffered a shoulder injury, which he tried to pitch through for two years before having surgery in 1984. He tried to come back from the injury in 1985, but retired.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Development = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The series was created by Shu Takumi, who wrote and directed the first three games. The first game was conceived in 2000 when Takumi's boss at the time, Shinji <unk>, gave him six months to create any type of game he wanted to ; Takumi had originally joined Capcom wanting to make mystery and adventure games, and felt that this was a big chance for him to make a mark as a creator. The game was designed to be simple, as Takumi wanted it to be easy enough for even his mother to play. It was originally going to be a detective game, with Phoenix being a private investigator, but at one point Takumi realized that finding and taking apart contradictions was not related to detective work, and felt that the main setting of the game should be <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Takumi felt that the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them together into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together ; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because he thought it would be more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own. 
<|endoftext|> After the first game's development was finished, <unk> told Takumi that they should make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. Takumi had originally planned to let Edgeworth be the prosecutor in all episodes in the second game, but during the production the development team learned that the character had become popular. This led to Takumi feeling that he had to use the character more carefully and <unk> ; he created the new prosecutor character <unk> von <unk>, to save Edgeworth for the game's last case, and avoid a situation where he – a supposed <unk> – loses every case. As Takumi wanted the three first Ace Attorney games to be parts of a larger work, he avoided making a lot of changes between games : art from the first game for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series ; and no new gameplay mechanics were added for Trials and Tribulations, as Takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche @-@ lock mechanic for Justice for All. 
<|endoftext|> For the fourth game, Takumi wrote the scenario and took on a supervisory role. He had wanted the series to end with the third game, as he felt Phoenix had been fully explored and that his story had been told ; he said that it is important to know when to end a story, that he did not want the series to become a shadow of its former self, and that he did not see any reason to continue it. Despite this, the spin @-@ off series Ace Attorney Investigations was created, being directed by Takeshi Yamazaki and produced by <unk> <unk> ; Takumi returned to the series to write the crossover Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright : Ace Attorney. He also directed and wrote Dai Gyakuten Saiban, which was described as being the first entry in a new Ace Attorney series. He said that he has mixed feelings about the series being developed by other Capcom staff, comparing it to a parent sending their child to their first day in school. Yamazaki and <unk> went on to direct and produce the main series entries Dual Destinies and Spirit of Justice. Due to exhaustion after working on Dual Dest

Her first volume of poetry Just Give Me a Cool <unk> of Water'Fore I <unk>, published in 1971 shortly after Caged Bird, became a best @-@ seller and was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. As scholar Marcia Ann Gillespie writes, Angelou had " fallen in love with poetry " during her early childhood in <unk>, Arkansas.

When it was announced that Angelou would read one of her poems at Clinton's inauguration, many in the popular press compared her role as inaugural poet with that of Frost's, especially what critic Zofia Burr called their " <unk> ", or their ability to speak for and to the American people. The press also pointed to the nation's social progress that a Black woman would " stand in the place of a white man " at his inauguration, and praised Angelou's involvement as the Clinton administration's " gesture of inclusion ". 
<|endoftext|> Angelou told her friend Oprah Winfrey that the call requesting her to write and recite the poem came from television producer Harry <unk>, who organized the inauguration, shortly after Clinton's election. Even though she suspected that Clinton made the request because " he understood that I am the kind of person who really does bring people together ", Angelou admitted feeling overwhelmed, and even requested that the audiences attending her speaking engagements pray for her. 
<|endoftext|> She followed her same " writing ritual " that she had followed for years and used in writing all of her books and poetry : she rented a hotel room, <unk> herself there from the early morning to the afternoon, and wrote on legal pads. After deciding upon the theme " America ", she wrote down everything she could think of about the country, which she then " pushed and squeezed into a poetic form ".

He was ordered to pay £ 100 compensation to PC Andrew Whitehead and £ 350 in costs. Woodhouse chose to play for Rushden & Diamonds to fulfil a promise he made to someone who was part of the consortium that took over the <unk> based club. He made his debut against Aldershot Town on 25 November 2006, in a 1 – 0 defeat. He made five appearances in the Conference National for Rushden, before deciding to leave to concentrate on his boxing career.

Woodhouse finished the 2007 – 08 football season having played in 29 Conference National matches, scoring once and receiving two red cards. On 17 May, Woodhouse achieved his sixth straight victory, maintaining his undefeated record against Dave Murray at Bramall Lane, defeating his opponent by knock @-@ out in the second round.

Since the attack, supported by only four horse artillery batteries, was on a prepared position held in superior strength, strong in machine guns, and covered by double the number of guns, including heavy howitzers, it was something of a <unk>. The attacking force's only advantage was its mobility. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Attack on 9 August = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The 3rd Light Horse Brigade set out to find and turn the German and Ottoman left, while at 04 : 00 the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade headed directly towards Bir el Abd along the old caravan route. By 05 : 00, they had driven in enemy outposts and reached high ground overlooking Bir el Abd. Royston's Column moved off at 05 : 00 with the intention of <unk> the Ottoman right, while the New Zealanders attacked in the centre ; the four brigades covering a front of 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ). 
<|endoftext|> The forward troops of the German and Ottoman rearguard, which held a front of about 10 miles ( 16 km ), were driven back to Bir el Abd by the New Zealanders. At this time, the attackers appeared likely to succeed, as they had firmly established themselves across the telegraph line and the old caravan road, supported by the Somerset and Leicester batteries. But the German, Austrian and Ottoman rearguard quickly realised how thin the attacking line was, and at 09 : 00 advanced out of their trenches to counterattack. This aggressive move was only checked by artillery fire from the Somerset Battery effectively combined with fire from machine guns. The subsequent fire fight made it extremely difficult for the mounted riflemen to maintain their position, and on the flanks the light horse were also held up. The German and Ottoman infantry renewed their attack towards a gap between the New Zealanders and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade, but the 5th Light Horse Regiment covered the gap, and the German and Ottoman advance was halted. 
<|endoftext|> Chauvel ordered the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, which had been unable to turn the German and Ottoman flank, to move towards the New Zealanders who renewed their efforts, but they only succeeded in exposing their flanks, as the Australians were unable to conform to their forward movement. By 10 : 30, all progress had stopped. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade continued to hold on in the centre, while both flanks were bent back by pressure from the strong German and Ottoman force. The result was that the New Zealanders ended up holding a very exposed salient line on the forward slopes of the hills overlooking the Hod. Fresh German or Ottoman reinforcements from El Arish, then launched a fierce counterattack on a front of about 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 0 km ), on the centre. This fell on the Canterbury and Auckland Regiments and a squadron of Warwickshire Yeomanry of the 5th Mounted Brigade under Chaytor's command. The New Zealanders were supported by machine guns ; one section, attached to the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment, fired all their guns directly on the advancing soldiers, stopping them when they were within 100 yards ( 91 m ) of the New Zealand position. 
<|endoftext|> By midday, the advance had been completely held up by determined counterattacks supported by fresh German or Ottoman troops from El Arish. Even more than at Katia on 5 August, these soldiers were more numerous, ready, full of fight and more strongly supported by well @-@ placed Austrian and Ottoman guns delivering both heavy and accurate fire. At this time, the rearguard launched another heavy counterattack with two columns of 5 @,@ 000 and 6 @,@ 000 German and Ottoman soldiers against the Canterbury and Auckland Regiments and the squadron of the Warwickshire Yeomanry. By 14 : 00, the attack had extended to the mounted force's left flank where the Ayrshire Battery with Royston's Column was badly cut up by this fire, losing 39 horses killed and making it extremely difficulty to move the guns. They were forced to retire nearly 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade, after advancing well up on the right flank, was also forced to give ground by the accuracy of enemy <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> A further withdrawal by the 3rd Light Horse Brigade made the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade's position critical and at 17 : 30, Chauvel gave orders for a general retirement. <unk> proved to be a challenge ; it was only the tenacity of the New Zealanders and nightfall which saved them from certain capture. At the last, the Machine Gun Squadron had all its guns in line, some of them firing at a range of 100 yards ( 91 m ) ; they were supported by squadrons of the 5th Mounted Brigade

<|endoftext|> There were also several congregationalists, who favoured autonomy for individual local churches. Their most influential divines were Thomas Goodwin, Philip <unk>, <unk> Simpson, Jeremiah <unk>, and William Bridge. They were often called the " dissenting brethren " in the Assembly. They have sometimes been labelled " <unk> ", but they rejected this term. The Assembly members for the most part reserved the label " Independent " for separatists who left the established church. The congregationalist divines cannot be equated with separatists and <unk>, as they had accepted episcopal ordination and remained in the Church of England. Their influence was assisted by the success of Oliver Cromwell and his New Model Army in the ongoing civil war. Cromwell and many others in the army supported <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> A third group of divines were known as <unk>, a term for those who believed that the state should have significant power over the church. The entire Assembly was Erastian in the sense that the body had been called by Parliament and was completely under state control. Those labelled " Erastian " at the Assembly believed the civil authority, rather than church officers, should hold the power of church discipline. This included the power to <unk> communion from unrepentant <unk>. They did not see any particular form of church government as divinely mandated, and because of this the dissenting brethren allied with them when it became clear that a presbyterian establishment would be much less tolerant of <unk> than Parliament. There were only two divines at the Assembly who held the Erastian view, John <unk> and Thomas Coleman, but the presence of members of Parliament, especially John <unk>, as well as the fact of parliamentary oversight of the Assembly, gave Erastian views <unk> influence. 
<|endoftext|> Several <unk>, supporters of the existing system of bishops, were also included in the summoning ordinance, but Parliament may have nominated them to lend greater legitimacy to the Assembly and not have expected them to attend because Charles had not approved of the Assembly. Only one, Daniel <unk>, participated, and he only until his arrest for treason in October 1643. 
<|endoftext|> Debate on church officers began on 19 October. The Assembly began with the issue of ordination, as many of the divines were concerned about the rise of various sectarian movements and the lack of any mechanism for ordination of ministers of the established church. While some members did not seem to think ordination necessary for preachers ( though they should not administer the sacraments without it ), a majority of the divines thought any regular preaching without ordination unacceptable and wished to erect a provisional presbytery for purposes of ordination. There was also debate at this early stage over the nature of the visible church. The congregationalists considered a church to be a single local congregation, while the majority considered the national church to be a unity and were alarmed at the prospect of a <unk> English church. Despite these debates, up until the end of 1643 there was hope that a common church government could be framed that would be satisfactory to all parties involved. 
<|endoftext|> On 3 or 4 January 1644, the five leading dissenting brethren signalled a break with the rest of the Assembly when they published An <unk> <unk>, a polemical pamphlet appealing to Parliament. It argued that the <unk> system was more amenable to state control of religious matters than that of the presbyterians because they did not desire the church to retain any real power except to withdraw <unk> from aberrant congregations. By 17 January, the majority of the Assembly had become convinced that the best way forward was a presbyterian system similar to that of the Scots, but the dissenting brethren were allowed to continue to state their case in hope that they could eventually be reconciled. It was hoped that by avoiding asserting that presbyterianism was established by divine right, the congregationalists could be accommodated. 
<|endoftext|> Despite these efforts, on 21 February it became clear just how fundamentally opposed the groups were. Philip <unk>, one of the dissenting brethren, asserted in a speech that a presbytery set over local congregations would become as powerful as the state and was dangerous to the commonwealth, provoking vigorous opposition from presbyterians. The next day, the Assembly finally began to establish a <unk> for presbyterian government. Owing to a strong belief in the unity of the church, the Assembly continued to try to find ways to reconcile the dissenting brethren with the majority throughout 1644, including the establishment of a special committee for that purpose in March. However, on 15 November, the dissenting brethren presented their reasons for disagreement with the rest of the Assembly to Parliament, and on 11 December the majority submitted a draft of a presbyterian form of government.

In 1120, Aguda agreed to cede the Sixteen Prefectures to the Song in exchange for transfer to the Jin of the annual tributary payments that the Song had been giving the Liao. By the end of 1120, however, the Jurchens had seized the Liao Supreme Capital, and offered the Song only parts of the Sixteen Prefectures. Among other things, the Jin would keep the Liao Western Capital of <unk> at the western end of the Sixteen Prefectures. The two sides agreed that the Jin would now attack the Liao Central Capital, whereas the Song would seize the Liao Southern Capital, Yanjing ( modern day Beijing ). 
<|endoftext|> The joint attack against the Liao had been planned for 1121, but it was <unk> for 1122. In February 23 of that year, the Jin captured the Liao Central Capital as promised. The Song delayed their entry into the war because it diverted resources to fighting the Western Xia in the northwest and suppressing a large popular rebellion in the south. When a Song army under Tong Guan's command finally attacked Yanjing in May 1122, the smaller forces of the weakened Liao repelled the invaders with ease. Another attack failed in the fall. Both times, Tong was forced to retreat back to Kaifeng. After the first attack, Aguda changed the terms of the agreement and only promised Yanjing and six other prefectures to the Song. In early 1123 it was Jurchen forces that easily took the Liao Southern Capital. They sacked it and enslaved its population. 
<|endoftext|> The quick collapse of the Liao led to more negotiations between the Song and the Jin. Jurchen military success and their effective control over the Sixteen Prefectures gave them more leverage. Aguda grew increasingly frustrated as he realized that despite their military failures the Song still intended to seize most of the prefectures. In the spring of 1123 the two sides finally set the terms of the first Song – Jin treaty. Only seven prefectures ( including Yanjing ) would be returned to the Song, and the Song would pay an annual indemnity of 300 @,@ 000 packs of silk and 200 @,@ 000 taels of silver to the Jin, as well as a one @-@ time payment of one million strings of copper coins to compensate the Jurchens for the tax revenue they would have earned had they not returned the prefectures.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Directed acyclic graphs representations of partial orderings have many applications in scheduling for systems of tasks with ordering constraints. An important class of problems of this type concern collections of objects that need to be updated, such as the cells of a spreadsheet after one of the cells has been changed, or the object files of a piece of computer software after its source code has been changed. In this context, a dependency graph is a graph that has a vertex for each object to be updated, and an edge connecting two objects whenever one of them needs to be updated earlier than the other. A cycle in this graph is called a circular dependency, and is generally not allowed, because there would be no way to consistently schedule the tasks involved in the cycle. <unk> graphs without circular <unk> form DAGs. 
<|endoftext|> For instance, when one cell of a spreadsheet changes, it is necessary to <unk> the values of other cells that depend directly or indirectly on the changed cell. For this problem, the tasks to be scheduled are the <unk> of the values of individual cells of the spreadsheet. Dependencies arise when an expression in one cell uses a value from another cell. In such a case, the value that is used must be <unk> earlier than the expression that uses it. <unk> ordering the dependency graph, and using this topological order to schedule the cell updates, allows the whole spreadsheet to be updated with only a single evaluation per cell. Similar problems of task ordering arise in <unk> for program compilation and instruction scheduling for low @-@ level computer program <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> A somewhat different DAG @-@ based formulation of scheduling constraints is used by the program evaluation and review technique ( <unk> ), a method for management of large human projects that was one of the first applications of DAGs. In this method, the vertices of a DAG represent milestones of a project rather than specific tasks to be performed. Instead, a task or activity is represented by an edge of a DAG, connecting two milestones that mark the beginning and completion of the task. Each such edge is labeled with an estimate for the amount of time that it will take a team of workers to perform the task. The longest path in this DAG represents the critical path of the project, the one that controls the total time for the project. Individual milestones can be scheduled according to the lengths of the longest paths ending at their vertices.

The two main extensions are : Nueces Bay, which extends west to the mouth of the Nueces River, and Oso Bay, which extends south to the mouth of Oso Creek. Every second, approximately 34 cubic meters ( 9 @,@ 000 U.S. gal ) of water flows into the bay. The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Aransas Pass. As a result of the seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 22 parts per thousand ( <unk> ), which is lower than the seawater average of 35 <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Following the shoreline beginning at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi on the bay's southeastern peninsula, the features of the bay can be best described. Moving northwest from the air station, Oso Bay must be crossed at its confluence with Corpus Christi Bay. On the other side of the meeting is Ward Island ( actually a peninsula ), where Texas A & M University – Corpus Christi is found. Further northwest, the shore begins to curve and off in the distance across the bay, the skyline of Corpus Christi is visible. Following the shore, the land dips inward and forms Emerald Cove, where a seawall has been constructed. Out in the bay, the Alta Vista Reef can be spotted from this location. Moving north along the shore, the seawall continues into the main city, until it reaches Industrial Canal, which has been dredged south of Nueces Bay and extends into the main bay to Port Aransas. Another seawall, which starts in Emerald Cove with gaps at places such as a spoils island that can be viewed in the bay and the canal, is slightly out in the water. This seawall ends when it reaches land at the southern portion of Corpus Christi Beach. North of

Each player plays different portions of the song. There is also a Pro Face @-@ Off mode, where two players battle at the same difficulty level.

<|endoftext|> Astraeus hygrometricus has been given a number of <unk> names that allude to its hygroscopic behavior, including the " <unk> earthstar ", the " hygroscopic earthstar ", the " barometer earthstar ", and the " water @-@ measure earthstar ". The resemblance to Geastrum species ( also known as true earthstars ) accounts for the common name " false earthstar ". The specific name is derived from the Greek words <unk> ( <unk> ) " wet " and <unk> ( <unk> ) " measure ". The German Mycological Society selected the species as their " Mushroom of the Year " in 2005. 
<|endoftext|> Studies in the 2000s showed that several species from Asian collection sites labelled under the specific epithet hygrometricus were actually considerably variable in a number of <unk> and microscopic characteristics. Molecular studies of the DNA sequences of the <unk> region of the ribosomal DNA from a number of Astraeus specimens from around the world have helped to clarify phylogenetic relationships within the genus. Based on these results, two Asian " hygrometricus " populations have been described as new species : A. asiaticus and A. odoratus ( synonymous with <unk>'s A. <unk> described in 2003 ). Preliminary DNA analyses suggests that the European A. hygrometricus described by Persoon is a different species than the North American version described by Morgan, and that the European population may be divided into two distinct <unk>, from France and from the Mediterranean. A 2010 study identified a Japanese species, previously identified as A. hygrometricus, as genetically distinct ; it has yet to be officially named. 
<|endoftext|> A form of the species found in Korea and Japan, A. hygrometricus var. koreanus, was named by <unk> <unk> in 1958 ; it was later ( 1976 ) published as a distinct species — A. koreanus — by <unk> <unk>.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Description = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Young specimens of A. hygrometricus have roughly spherical fruit bodies that typically start their development partially embedded in the substrate. A smooth whitish mycelial layer covers the fruit body, and may be partially encrusted with debris. As the fruit body matures, the mycelial layer tears away, and the outer tissue layer, the exoperidium, breaks open in a star @-@ shaped ( <unk> ) pattern to form 4 – 20 irregular " rays ". This simultaneously pushes the fruit body above ground to reveal a round spore case enclosed in a thin <unk> <unk>. The rays open and close in response to levels of moisture in the environment, opening up in high humidity, and closing when the air is dry. This is possible because the exoperidium is made of several different layers of tissue ; the innermost, fibrous layer is hygroscopic, and <unk> or <unk> the entire ray as it loses or gains moisture from its surroundings. This adaptation enables the fruit body to disperse spores at times of <unk> moisture, and reduce evaporation during dry periods. Further, dry fruit bodies with the rays curled up may be readily blown about by the wind, allowing them to scatter spores from the pore as they roll. 
<|endoftext|> The fruit body is 1 – 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) in diameter from tip to tip when expanded. The exoperidium is thick, and the rays are typically <unk> ( divided into small areas by cracks and crevices ) on the upper surface, and are dark grey to black. The spore case is <unk> ( lacking a stalk ), light gray to tan color and 1 to 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 to 1 @.@ 2 in ) broad with a felt @-@ like or <unk> ( coated with loose scaly crust ) surface ; the top of the spore case is opened by an irregular slit, tear or pore. The interior of the spore case, the gleba, is white and solid when young, and divided into oval <unk> — a characteristic that helps to distinguish it from Geastrum. The gleba becomes brown and powdery as the specimen matures. Small dark <unk> threads ( rhizomorphs ) extend from the base of the fruit body into the substrate. The rhizomorphs are fragile, and often break off after maturity.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Giacomo Meyerbeer ( born Jacob Liebmann Beer ; 5 September 1791 – 2 May 1864 ) was a German opera composer of Jewish birth who has been described as perhaps the most successful stage composer of the nineteenth century. With his 1831 opera Robert le diable and its successors, he gave the genre of grand opera'decisive character '. Meyerbeer's grand opera style was achieved by his merging of German orchestra style with Italian vocal tradition. These were employed in the context of sensational and melodramatic libretti created by Eugène Scribe and were enhanced by the up @-@ to @-@ date theatre technology of the Paris Opéra. They set a standard which helped to maintain Paris as the opera capital of the nineteenth century. 
<|endoftext|> Born to a very wealthy Berlin family, Meyerbeer began his musical career as a pianist but soon decided to devote himself to opera, spending several years in Italy studying and composing. His 1824 opera Il crociato in Egitto was the first to bring him Europe @-@ wide reputation, but it was Robert le diable ( 1831 ) which raised his status to great celebrity. His public career, lasting from then until his death, during which he remained a dominating figure in the world of opera, was summarized by his contemporary Hector Berlioz, who claimed that he'has not only the luck to be talented, but the talent to be lucky.'He was at his peak with his operas Les Huguenots ( 1836 ) and Le prophète ( 1849 ) ; his last opera ( L 'Africaine ) was performed posthumously. His operas made him the most frequently performed composer at the world's leading opera houses in the nineteenth century. 
<|endoftext|> At the same time as his successes in Paris, Meyerbeer, as a Prussian Court Kapellmeister ( Director of Music ) from 1832, and from 1843 as Prussian General Music Director, was also influential in opera in Berlin and throughout Germany. He was an early supporter of Richard Wagner, enabling the first production of the latter's opera, Rienzi. He was commissioned to write the patriotic opera Ein <unk> in <unk> to celebrate the reopening of the Berlin Royal Opera House in 1844 and wrote music for certain Prussian state occasions. 
<|endoftext|> Apart from around 50 songs, Meyerbeer wrote little except for the stage. The critical assaults of Wagner and his supporters, especially after his death, led to a decline in the popularity of his works ; his operas were suppressed by the Nazi regime in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses through most of the twentieth century. Meyerbeer's works are only infrequently performed today.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The novel is written in the third @-@ person with flashbacks to specific events in the life of Simón Bolívar, " the General ". It begins on May 8, 1830 in Santa Fe de Bogotá. The General is preparing for his journey towards the port of Cartagena de <unk>, intending to leave Colombia for Europe. Following his resignation as President of Gran Colombia, the people of the lands he liberated have now turned against him, <unk> anti @-@ Bolívar graffiti and throwing waste at him. The General is anxious to move on, but has to remind the Vice @-@ President @-@ elect, General Domingo <unk>, that he has yet to receive a valid passport to leave the country.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> According to literary critic David <unk>, the labyrinth of the novel's title refers to " a series of <unk> that are contingent upon matters of history, geography, and biography... that consistently and conclusively result in a dead end " — in this case, the General's own death. His final voyage along the Magdalena River involves a doubling back and forth from one location to another that leads him and his followers nowhere. The labyrinth does not lead to happiness ; instead, it results in madness from constant <unk> on the past and an impossible future. At the end of his life, the General is reduced to a <unk> of his former self. The labyrinth also recalls the labyrinth built to imprison the <unk> in Greek mythology, and the endless travelling and searching of ancient Greek heroes. In <unk>'s view, " The Labyrinth mirrors the <unk> and <unk> of the hero in search for meaning and resolution to the <unk> of life ". 
<|endoftext|> García Márquez depicts the General's body itself as a labyrinth. His doctor observes that " everything that enters the body, adds weight, and everything that leaves it is <unk>. " The General's body is described as a " labyrinth coming to a literal dead end ". The labyrinth is also expressed in geographical and architectural imagery. The country's destiny is imagined as a break @-@ up, a folding of north into south. The seas offer the hope of a new life and a new world, but the closer the General is to Colombia, the less chance he has of moving on. García Márquez describes buildings as " daunting, <unk> ( if not exactly reiterating ) with the echoes of a bloody past ". The portrayal of the General's world as a labyrinth is <unk> by his constant return to cities and towns he has visited before : each location belongs to the past as well as to the present. The General in his Labyrinth <unk> the lines between <unk> in a man @-@ made world and wandering in the natural world. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Fate and love = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Bolívar's fate is known from the beginning, and García Márquez constantly uses images which <unk> this ending. For instance, a clock stuck at seven minutes past one, the exact time of the General's death, appears repeatedly in the novel. This sense of fate is introduced in the <unk>, which comes from a letter written by the historical Bolívar to General Santander on August 4, 1823 : " It seems that the devil controls the business of my life. " As Palencia @-@ Roth points out, the word used for devil here is <unk> rather than the more familiar <unk>. <unk> derives from the Greek word <unk>, which can equally mean divine power, fate, or destiny. Accordingly, the General <unk> to his fate and accepts his death as destiny. 
<|endoftext|> The theme of love is central to the novel. Bolívar had a reputation as a <unk>, and books have been written on his <unk> ; but as depicted in this novel, during the last seven months of his life, the General could no longer engage in the activities that had fueled that reputation. García Márquez mentions a woman every few pages, many of whom are his own invention, exploring love through the General's memories. Palencia @-@ Roth notes that the presence of these women " allows a <unk> exploration of his life before his final journey " and suggests that García Márquez uses love as a barometer of the General's heart and health. Although Bolívar is usually thought to have died from tuberculosis, Palencia @-@ Roth believes that for the author, the General dies from the lack of love. " <unk> by many of his countrymen, abandoned by all but a few aides and associates, left — during the final seven months of his life — without even the companionship of his longtime mistress Manuela <unk>, Bolívar had no choice but to die of a broken heart.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> When stars form in the present Milky Way galaxy they are composed of about 71 % hydrogen and 27 % helium, as measured by mass, with a small fraction of heavier elements.

The portion of heavier elements may be an indicator of the likelihood that the star has a planetary system.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The motion of a star relative to the Sun can provide useful information about the origin and age of a star, as well as the structure and evolution of the surrounding galaxy. The components of motion of a star consist of the radial velocity toward or away from the Sun, and the traverse angular movement, which is called its proper motion. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> velocity is measured by the <unk> shift of the star's spectral lines, and is given in units of km / s. The proper motion of a star, its parallax, is determined by precise <unk> measurements in units of <unk> @-@ arc seconds ( <unk> ) per year. With knowledge of the star's parallax and its distance, the proper motion velocity can be calculated. Together with the radial velocity, the total velocity can be calculated. Stars with high rates of proper motion are likely to be relatively close to the Sun, making them good candidates for parallax measurements. 
<|endoftext|> When both rates of movement are known, the space velocity of the star relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed.

When the regular season began, he was initially effective, winning three games against one defeat in his first four starts, including two complete game victories against the Yankees. At this point, he was 4 – 0 against the Yankees, earning him the moniker " Yankee Killer " from sportswriter Chester L. Smith of the Pittsburgh Press. Although his ERA of 4 @.@ 88 was considered high, it was due in large part to his loss against the Kansas City Athletics who scored six earned runs in just two innings. On July 4, he defeated the Yankees once again, making him 5 – 0 against them in his career, and 7 – 4 overall for the 1957 season, and had lowered his ERA to 4 @.@ 02. That was his last victory of the season, however, which he followed with two consecutive losses, pitching a total of four innings ; he did not appear in another game until September 2. He recorded a save against the Baltimore Orioles on September 7, but closed the season with two consecutive losses against the Yankees, though he pitched well in the second game, giving up just three hits and two earned runs in eight innings. His season totals include a 7 – 8 record, and a 4 @.@ 72 ERA in 122 ⅓ inning pitched.

However, he finished the spring with two consecutive losses, including one to the Pittsburgh Pirates, with whom his father was a special assistant to their manager. He opened the regular season with a complete game victory against the Yankees on April 16. On May 2, he pitched his only career complete game shutout, a 6 – 0 victory against the Detroit Tigers and future Hall of Famer Jim <unk>, improving his record to 3 – 1 for the season. Over the next two months, his average innings pitched declined during his starts, and on several occasions he entered the game in relief. He went <unk> from June 12 to August 9, when he defeated the Yankees. He recorded just one more victory in 1958, and completed the season with an 8 – 9 record, a 4 @.@ 94 ERA, and 71 strikeouts in a career @-@ high 149 ⅓ innings pitched. 
<|endoftext|> On February 8, 1959, the Red Sox announced that they had Sisler signed for the 1959 season. After what was considered a " disappointing " season, he did not impress with his first outing in spring training, giving up two hits and five bases on balls in just two innings of work. <unk> of pitching depth was a noted weakness for the Red Sox entering the season, with unpredictable youth and with hopes that Sisler could regain his previous level of success. Sisler opened the season slated as a relief pitcher with the idea that he would start in certain cases. In three relief appearances through April, he had a 6 @.@ 75 ERA in 6 ⅔ inning pitched.

This shark may be found from the surf zone, often in water barely deep enough to cover its body, to a maximum depth of 70 m ( 230 ft ) on coral reefs ; it is most common at a depth of 5 – 30 m ( 16 – 98 ft ).

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The tawny nurse shark grows to a maximum length of 3 @.@ 2 m ( 10 ft ). It has a robust, cylindrical body with a broadly rounded and flattened head. The eyes are small and face laterally, with prominent ridges over them and smaller spiracles behind. There are a pair of long, slender <unk> in front of the nostrils. The mouth is small, with the lower lip divided into three lobes. There are 29 – 33 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 26 – 28 tooth rows in the lower jaw, arranged in an <unk> ( overlapping ) pattern with the outermost 2 – 4 functional rows separated from the rest by a narrow space. Each tooth resembles a fan, with a broad base rising to a small, sharp central point flanked by 3 or more smaller <unk> on both sides. As the shark ages, the teeth become relatively taller and thicker. The fourth and fifth pairs of gill slits are placed much closer together than the others. 
<|endoftext|> The dorsal and pelvic fins are angular, with the first dorsal fin larger than the second. The pectoral fins are narrow, pointed, and <unk> ( sickle @-@ shaped ) ; their shape separates this species from the similar @-@ looking nurse shark. The origin of the first dorsal fin is about even with the origin of the pelvic fins, while the origin of the anal fin is even with or somewhat behind the origin of the second dorsal fin. The caudal fin has a shallow upper lobe and barely present lower lobe, comprising about a quarter of the total length in adults. The dermal denticles are diamond @-@ shaped, bearing 4 – 5 faint ridges radiating from a blunt point. Tawny nurse sharks are yellowish, reddish, or grayish brown above and off @-@ white below, and are capable of slowly changing their color to better blend with the environment. Young sharks have starkly white lower eyelids. 
<|endoftext|> Many tawny nurse sharks found off the coasts of Japan, Taiwan, and the <unk> Islands lack a second dorsal fin. This physical <unk> has been speculated to result from pregnant females being exposed to water of unusually high salinity and / or temperature, possibly from human activity. In 1986, a 2 @.@ 9 m ( 9 ft 6 in ) long adult male with both a missing dorsal fin and partial albinism ( in the form of white body color with gray @-@ brown eyes ) was captured off <unk> Prefecture, Japan.

Robert Christgau awarded the album a C + rating, giving the album a <unk> review, while Janet Maslin defended it in Rolling Stone, writing : " These latest live versions of his old songs have the effect of liberating Bob Dylan from the originals. " When Dylan brought the tour to the U.S. in September 1978, the press described the look and sound as a'Las Vegas Tour '. The 1978 tour grossed more than $ 20 million, and Dylan told the Los Angeles Times that he had debts because " I had a couple of bad years.

Zelanti, taking advantage of the small number of the electors and the absence of the French and Spanish cardinals, tried to achieve a quick election of Cardinal <unk> Chigi. In one ballot he was only two votes short of being elected. The efforts of Zelanti met with strong protests from the ambassadors of France and Spain, but, <unk> for them, Cardinal Orsini, protector of the Kingdom of Naples and the only crown @-@ cardinal present in the early ballots, was able to join some neutral cardinals to block Chigi ’ s candidature.

<|endoftext|> Cardinal de Bernis entered the conclave at the end of March and took the leadership of the anti @-@ Jesuit faction from the hands of Cardinal Orsini, who could have blocked Zelanti ’ s actions only with the great difficulties. Bernis immediately established a regular correspondence with French ambassador Marquis d <unk>, which was in violation of the fundamental law of the conclave. <unk> of France and Spain urged Bernis to insist that the election of the future pope be made to depend on his written engagement to suppress the Jesuits. Bernis refused, answering that demanding from the future pope a written or oral promise to destroy the Society of Jesus would be in violation of the canon law. In spite of this refusal, during the next few weeks Bernis consecutively rejected all candidates proposed by Zelanti as too devoted to the Jesuits.

The Spaniards had fewer <unk> than Bernis and, supported by Cardinal <unk>, took the matter into their own hands. They paid attention to the only friar in the Sacred College, Cardinal Lorenzo Ganganelli, <unk> The attitude of Ganganelli towards the Jesuits was a great mystery – he had been educated by the Jesuits and it was said that he received the red hat at the instance of Father Lorenzo <unk>, general of the Society of Jesus, but during the <unk> of Clement XIII he did not engage himself in the defence of the Order. Cardinal Solis began by sounding him out as to his willingness to give the promise required by the Bourbon princes as an indispensable condition for election. Ganganelli answered that " he recognized in the sovereign <unk> the right to extinguish, with good conscience, the Society of Jesus, provided he observed the canon law ; and that it was desirable that the pope should do everything in his power to satisfy the wishes of the Crowns ". It is not certain whether it was a written or only an oral promise, but this declaration fully satisfied the ambassadors. 
<|endoftext|> In the same time Zelanti, also began to incline to give their support to Ganganelli, looking upon him as indifferent or even favourable to the Jesuits. It seems that the attitude of Zelanti was decided by the secret negotiations between their leaders Alessandro and Gian Francesco Albani and the Spanish cardinals.

For reasons of orbital stability, such multi @-@ star systems are often organized into hierarchical sets of binary stars. Larger groups called star clusters also exist. These range from loose stellar associations with only a few stars, up to enormous globular clusters with hundreds of thousands of stars. Such systems orbit our Milky Way galaxy.

This is particularly true for very massive O and B class stars, where 80 % of the stars are believed to be part of multiple @-@ star systems. The proportion of single star systems increases with decreasing star mass, so that only 25 % of red dwarfs are known to have stellar companions.

The design for Destroyers No. 51 through No. 56 — what became the O 'Brien class, was to closely follow the design of the Cassin and Aylwin classes from fiscal year 1912. The chief of the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ordnance ( <unk> ) suggested that the new destroyers be equipped with ten torpedo tubes and urged that the new 21 @-@ inch ( 533 mm ) torpedo be adopted. The General Board agreed in principle, adopting the 21 @-@ inch torpedo tubes, but eliminated <unk>'s proposed centerline torpedo tubes and keeping the number of tubes at eight, the same as the Cassin and Aylwin classes. The additional weight of the larger torpedoes, 5 long tons ( 5 @.@ 1 t ) of top weight, was offset by reducing the planned two aft @-@ facing guns to a single one. This gave the class four 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) guns, which, again, matched the battery of the Cassin and Aylwin classes.

During the 18th century the Russian Navy introduced " <unk> ", Baltic variants on the Mediterranean <unk>, for inshore duties. The <unk> were good <unk>, could be rowed if necessary and had more guns and greater stores than galleys ; they were also less expensive to maintain. The Russian designs influenced Chapman and the Swedish naval commanders. Consequently, Chapman's designs for new ships were <unk> on those principles, but with adaptations to archipelago warfare. 
<|endoftext|> Chapman's archipelago frigates provided better protection for their crew than the galleys they replaced, and up to three times the capacity for stores and provisions. They could operate in the narrow, shallow waters around <unk> in all <unk> and in open water in all but the worst storms. They had a deeper draft than galleys, but considerably shallower draft than traditional sailing warships.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Of the new designs, <unk> and hemmemas best fit the description of " archipelago frigate " because of their similarities to small ocean @-@ going frigates.

It had a low hull with no forecastle, only a low quarterdeck, and no <unk> deck. It had three masts that were initially rigged with <unk> sails, like a galley. The navy later replaced the <unk> rigs with a more conventional square @-@ sail frigate rig. The early design provided for 14 pairs of oars with four men per oar. The rowers plied their oars from the gun deck through oar ports positioned between the gunports, close to the waterline, which gave the rowers better leverage. The oars were also placed on a rectangular <unk>, designed to further improve the leverage. Even so, hemmemas performed poorly when rowed and were difficult in contrary winds. They were slower than ordinary sailing ships, but sailed better than galleys. 
<|endoftext|> During the Russian war of 1788 – 1790, Sweden built three hemmemas of a new design. They were considerably larger, 44 @.@ 5 by 11 m ( 146 by 36 ft ), and the number of oars were increased to 20 pairs. They also had some of the heaviest broadsides, even when compared with the much larger frigates of the high seas navy. The artillery officer Carl Fredrik <unk> had cooperated with Chapman to increase the main armament to twenty @-@ two 36 @-@ pounders and two 12 @-@ pounders, which increased the draft by about 30 cm ( 1 ft ). The addition of diagonal <unk> to reinforce the hull allowed the later hemmemas to carry guns more powerful even than those on the largest sailing frigates of the high seas navy. Due to their considerable firepower and relative size, naval historian Jan <unk> has described the hemmemas as " super archipelago frigates ". 
<|endoftext|> The hemmema's design was very similar to that of the turuma. The primary difference was that the turuma's oarsmen sat on the weather deck above the guns, whereas the hemmema's oarsmen sat on the <unk>.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Crush contains ten levels in each of the four locations, all based on an event in Danny's past. The levels represent Danny's mind : a dark city landscape with many tall buildings and the occasional street lamp, a hotel resting aside a seaside location, a dark and mysterious funfair, and a haunted childhood bedroom. Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can <unk> into narrow areas and jump a small height. 
<|endoftext|> The main gameplay feature of Crush is the ability to <unk> the layout of a level between 2D and 3D representations to reach seemingly inaccessible areas and solve the game's puzzles. The player can switch the third @-@ person camera between four directional side views and a top @-@ down view at any time while in 3D. When in these views, the player can have Danny " crush " the level, collapsing all 3D elements into 2D ; crushing from side views results in a 2D platformer @-@ like view, while crushing from the top @-@ down view provides a 2D top @-@ down perspective. <unk> can connect and merge platforms on the same visual plane in the 3D view but separated by a large distance, creating pathways across the level in the 2D view. The player can also " <unk> " the level at any time. Certain blocks, when crushed, become either obstacles through which Danny cannot pass, or ledges the player can use to reach other parts of the level. Attempts to crush a level in any manner that would harm Danny are thwarted. However, <unk> can leave Danny in a helpless state, such as hanging in mid @-@ air. 
<|endoftext|> Enemy monsters inhabit the levels, but the player can crush them by flattening impassable blocks against them. The player may also encounter <unk> in the form of alarm clocks that will begin to <unk> when crushed for the first time and can only be stopped when Danny jumps on them. Danny wakes from his mental <unk> if he falls off the level or too high of a surface, is touched by a monster, or fails to stop a <unk>, but the C.R.U.S.H. device <unk> him at the start of the level or the last <unk> Danny passed. 
<|endoftext|> Throughout the levels are scattered large spheres and cylinders, which the player can roll when crushed appropriately. These can then be used as platforms or to depress switches. <unk> pieces can be collected to reveal concept art and extras in the game's menus. Some of Danny's " thoughts ", represented by glowing neon icons on the walls of the level, are only activated when the level is crushed in a manner that does not obscure them. Some thoughts allow Danny to jump higher or stop time. Once the player completes each level, they are graded by the duration of Danny's stay on the level, how many times Danny " <unk> up ", and a bonus for collecting all marbles, the <unk> piece, and a hidden thought trophy. The thought trophy, once completed by crushing, unlocks a level's special challenge mode for later play which requires time @-@ limited completion of the level with an allotted number of <unk>.

Weary of constantly being asked for her primary genre, she felt that recording a Christmas album would finally pave a way for her to explore other different genres. She remarked, " I always get asked what genre I'm in :'Is this country or pop or rock? What are you?'And what's cool about making the Christmas album was,'Oh, there are no limitations! We can do whatever we want!'". She further added, " The thing about Christmas is that it almost doesn 't matter what mood you're in or what kind of a year you've had — it's a fresh start.

Despite having been raised in a Jewish faith and unfamiliar with Christmas songs, Kurstin still agreed to produce the project. As a result, the record marked the second time her studio album only had a single producer ( the first being David Kahne solely producing My December in 2007 ).

He told Treasury Secretary John C. Spencer that the only gold coins of that size in commerce, the Spanish and Colombian half @-@ <unk>, were unpopular and had not been struck for more than twenty years. This seemed to satisfy the committee as nothing more was done for the time, and when a gold dollar was proposed again in 1846, McKay's committee recommended against it. 
<|endoftext|> Even before 1848, record amounts of gold were flowing to American mints to be struck into coin, but the California Gold Rush vastly increased these quantities. This renewed calls for a gold dollar, as well as for a higher denomination than the eagle ( $ 10 piece ), then the largest gold coin. In January 1849, McKay introduced a bill for a gold dollar, which was referred to his committee. There was much discussion in the press about the proposed coin ; one newspaper published a proposal for an annular gold dollar, that is, with a hole in the middle to increase its small diameter. McKay amended his legislation to provide for a double eagle ( $ 20 gold coin ) and wrote to Patterson, who replied stating that the annular gold dollar would not work, and neither would another proposal to have dollar piece consisting of a gold <unk> in a silver coin. Nevertheless, Gobrecht's successor as chief engraver, James B. Longacre, prepared patterns, including some with a square hole in the middle. 
<|endoftext|> McKay got his fellow Democrat, New Hampshire Senator Charles Atherton, to introduce the bill to authorize the gold dollar and the double eagle in the Senate on February 1, 1849 — Atherton was chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.

The dollar was attacked by <unk> from the Whig Party, then in the minority, on the grounds that it would be too small, would be <unk> and in bad light might be mistakenly spent as a half <unk>, the coins being similar in size.

Pennsylvania Representative Joseph <unk>, a Whig, spoke against the bill, noting that Patterson opposed the new denominations, and that the idea had been repeatedly turned down, whenever considered. Another Whig, Massachusetts's Charles Hudson, related that Patterson had sent a real and a counterfeit gold dollar to his committee and the majority of members had been unable to tell the difference. McKay made no answer to these claims, but others did, including New York Congressman Henry <unk>, who assured the House that the counterfeiting allegations were greatly exaggerated. The point was, he indicated, that the double eagle and gold dollar were wanted by the public, and, in the case of the gold dollar could help money circulate in small communities where <unk> were not accepted.

The HNC was an <unk> legislative @-@ style civilian advisory body they had created at the request of the United States — South Vietnam's main sponsor — to give a veneer of civilian rule. The dissolution dismayed the Americans, particularly the ambassador, Maxwell D. Taylor, who engaged in an angry war of words with various generals including Khánh and threatened aid cuts. They were unable to do anything about the fait <unk> that had been handed to them, because they strongly desired to win the Vietnam War and needed to support the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Instead, Taylor's searing verbal attacks were counterproductive as they galvanized the Vietnamese officers around the embattled Khánh. At the time, Khánh's leadership was under threat from his fellow generals, as well as Taylor, who had fallen out with him and was seeking his removal. 
<|endoftext|> The genesis of the removal of the HNC was a power struggle within the ruling junta. Khánh, who had been saved from an earlier coup attempt in September 1964 by the intervention of some younger generals dubbed the Young Turks, was indebted to them and needed to satisfy their wishes to stay in power. The Young Turks disliked a group of older officers who had been in high leadership positions but were now in powerless posts, and wanted to <unk> them completely. As a result, they decided to hide their political motives by introducing a policy to <unk> retire all general officers with more than 25 years of service. The chief of state Phan Khắc Sửu, an elderly figure appointed by the military to give a semblance of civilian rule, did not want to sign the decree without the agreement of the HNC, which mostly consisted of old men. The HNC recommended against the new policy, and the younger officers, led by I Corps commander General Nguyễn <unk> Thi and Air Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, disbanded the body and arrested some of its members along with other politicians. 
<|endoftext|> As a result of this event, Taylor summoned Khánh to his office.

Although issue 14 made a passing reference to <unk>, the series since developed its own pocket universe in which the supernatural or paranormal did not play a large role in the lives of most ordinary people, and in Earth @-@ threatening circumstances no superhero <unk> were shown or hinted at, suggesting that <unk> no longer existed there. However, some DC Comics characters — most notably the fringe supernatural characters such as Zatanna, The Phantom Stranger, Shade, The Changing Man, Dream of the <unk>, and Swamp Thing made appearances. 
<|endoftext|> John Constantine, the main character of Hellblazer, was portrayed as a kind of confidence man and occult detective who did morally questionable things, arguably for the greater good. He usually triumphed through <unk>, deceit, and <unk>, but often made more enemies in the process than he defeated. Indeed, it was a common theme in the book that Constantine was unable to effect any lasting change or enjoy <unk> victories. While sometimes striving for the good of mankind, Constantine was often <unk> and a dangerous person to have as a friend, as the lives and souls of those around him became <unk> involved in his <unk>. He took pains to protect himself from direct attacks, but his friends and relatives were often endangered in order to strike at him. The spirits of deceased friends haunted him, individually or as an entourage of ghosts. 
<|endoftext|> Constantine made appearances in other comic book titles, such as Crisis on <unk> <unk>, <unk> Crisis, Green Arrow, Green Lantern, The Sandman, Lucifer, and Shade, the Changing Man. He was a recurring supporting character in both Swamp Thing and The Books of Magic throughout their numerous <unk>. Some attempts to use the character in other superhero or family @-@ friendly comics were altered due to editorial mandate, such as " <unk> <unk> <unk> " in <unk> and Captain <unk> ( who refers to Constantine as " an <unk> <unk> in England " ). Grant Morrison created " Willoughby Kipling " for Doom Patrol after being refused Constantine by DC, changing his appearance to that of Richard E Grant in <unk> and I, following which Phil <unk> was forced to create " Ambroise <unk> " in Stanley and His Monster, having been refused both Constantine and Willoughby Kipling. 
<|endoftext|> John Constantine was reintroduced into the DC Universe in 2011, initially in the <unk> Day crossover event title Search for the Swamp Thing, and in the ongoing The New 52 title Justice League Dark.

Delano's run was characterised by his political satire, taking on late 1980s and 1990s tropes such as with city <unk> being literal demons, and Constantine meeting with <unk> from the Houses of Parliament. He also had <unk> issues crop up, especially in " The Fear Machine " ( issues # 15 @-@ 22 ), where John fell in with a travelling community of environmental activists. Indeed, editor Karen Berger noted on Delano's departure the irony that his final issue was handed in the week that Margaret Thatcher was forced out of office. 
<|endoftext|> There were five main storylines in the run. The first, collected as " Original <unk> ", deals with John travelling to America to <unk> a demon, <unk>, and investigate a strange cult known as <unk>'s Army, crossing paths with a demon called Nergal ( from whom he gains demon blood ), and having to be responsible for killing an old friend, Gary Lester, and betraying another, called <unk>, in the process.

In Kingdom Hearts II, Roxas is introduced as a boy living in a digital replica of a city called Twilight Town. <unk> of the virtual nature of the city, Roxas begins to dream about the adventures of Sora, the series'protagonist. He later encounters Axel, a member of Organization XIII who was given orders to rescue him, and Naminé, a Nobody who tells him he is Sora's other half. Shortly after meeting, Ansem the <unk>, the creator of the virtual world, Roxas learns the nature of Twilight Town as well as that Ansem erased his memory, and implanted false ones to make Roxas unaware of his past and then make him merge with Sora. Ansem leads Roxas to an old mansion where once reaching an asleep Sora, Roxas rejoins with him, allowing Sora to wake up. Sora later learns that Roxas is his Nobody, created during the events of the first game after Sora briefly turned into a Heartless. Xemnas brought Roxas to Organization XIII as he could wield the Keyblade, a weapon which would help them to capture hearts. Roxas later betrayed the Organization and encountered one of Sora's friends, <unk>, who captured him to help Sora wake up. Roxas makes two appearances near the end of the game. The first is in a mental battle with Sora depicted as a cut @-@ scene, and the second is with Naminé, who has merged with her other self, <unk>. In the re @-@ released version of the title, Kingdom Hearts II Final Mix, Roxas'fight against Sora was expanded, making him a boss character. The battle was meant to be interactive in Kingdom Hearts II, but time constraints imposed from creating fights for the other Organization XIII members prevented inclusion. With the opportunity to include the fight, Nomura's team worked hard to make it entertaining for players. Additional scenes regarding Roxas'past were added to the game to add to the mystery around him. 
<|endoftext|> Kingdom Hearts 358 / 2 Days, a prequel to Kingdom Hearts II, reveals Roxas'life with Organization XIII. Unlike the other Organization members, Roxas lacks memories of his previous life. During Roxas'time in the Organization, he is placed under Axel's watch, and the two become friends. After Axel is sent to Castle <unk>, Roxas is entrusted with Xion, another Keyblade <unk>, whom he befriends. Roxas reacts to Sora's memory restoration and starts questioning why he uses the Keyblade and doubt the Organization's motives. When he discovers that Xion is a replica of Sora created by Xemnas, Roxas is compelled to <unk> from Organization XIII to find answers and meet Sora. After doing so, he encounters Xion, who tries to attack and absorb him so that she would become the " real " Sora ; however, the fight ends with Xion's defeat who <unk> Roxas to free the hearts the Organization captured. The death of his friend, coupled with full knowledge of how <unk> Xemnas truly is, inspires Roxas to defeat Xemnas and release the hearts he and Xion captured for the Organization. On his way, Roxas is confronted by <unk> who knocks him unconscious in order to help Ansem and Naminé wake up Sora. 
<|endoftext|> A virtual representation of Roxas appears as a boss character in the mobile phone game Kingdom Hearts coded, in which he confronts a virtual representation of Sora, he later appears in the ending as one of the people connected to Sora's heart who may have a chance at returning one day. He makes a cameo appearance at the end of Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep, where he is shown with Xion and Axel eating sea @-@ salt ice cream in Twilight Town, as well as in Kingdom Hearts 3D : Dream Drop <unk> where Roxas contacts both Axel and Sora through dreams. He also appears in <unk> Amano's manga and Tomoko <unk>'s novels, which reprise his role in the video games.

However, he <unk> from revealing too much detail about him and stated that he would become an important, playable character for the franchise. The developers wrote Roxas'story in Kingdom Hearts II to add mixed feelings to
<|endoftext|>. This differs from <unk>, where there is a large amount of overhang of the maxilla. The teeth also have a middle ridge, with five fewer prominent ridges on either side. This is similar to the size ridges seen on Kentrosaurus. Like all stegosaurians, the denticles on the teeth are rounded at the tips, in contrast to <unk>. Also, like Huayangosaurus, but unlike Kentrosaurus and Stegosaurus, Paranthodon possesses a prominent <unk> <unk> ( a ridge beside the tooth row ). Paranthodon teeth preserve wear, possibly cause by rubbing with other teeth. However, wear is absent on most teeth, similar to Huayangosaurus, meaning it is likely that Paranthodon lacked <unk> between teeth. Paranthodon is distinguished from other <unk> by a long, wide, posterior process of the premaxilla, teeth in the maxilla with a very large <unk>, and large ridges on the tooth crowns. Not all of these features were considered valid in a 2008 review of Stegosauria, with the only <unk> found being the possession of a partial second bony palate on the maxilla. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Classification = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Currently, Paranthodon is classified as a <unk> related to Stegosaurus, Tuojiangosaurus, and <unk>. However, when Broom assigned the name Palaeoscincus africanus to the Paranthodon fossils, he classified them as an ankylosaurian. This classification was later changed by Nopcsa, who found that Paranthodon best resembled a stegosaurid ( before the group was truly defined ). Coombs ( 1978 ) found Paranthodon to be an ankylosaurian, like <unk>, naming it <unk> <unk> sedis. However, in reviews by <unk> in 1981, it was found to instead represent a stegosaurid from the Late Cretaceous. Multiple phylogenetic analyses have placed Paranthodon in Stegosauria, and often in Stegosauridae. A 2010 analysis including nearly all species of stegosaurians found that Paranthodon was outside Stegosauridae, and in a <unk> with Tuojiangosaurus, Huayangosaurus, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>. However, when the latter two genera were removed, Paranthodon grouped with Tuojiangosaurus just outside Stegosauridae, and Huayangosaurus grouped with <unk> in <unk>. Below is the analysis with all included genera. 
<|endoftext|> Other analyses have found Paranthodon closely related to Tuojiangosaurus, <unk>, and Kentrosaurus within <unk>. Even though phylogenetic analyses recognize Paranthodon as a stegosaurid, the type material actually bears no <unk> of Stegosauria. However, the material is likely of <unk> nature, and <unk> by many authors have found it to be within the group.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The Kirkwood Formation is in South Africa, and many fossils of different species and genera have been discovered in it, with Paranthodon being the first uncovered. The formation is of a Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous age, with the oldest deposits from the Tithonian, about 145 @.@ 5 million years ago, and the youngest rocks being from the Valanginian, about 136 @.@ 4 million years ago. A large variety of different animal groups have been found in the formation, including dinosaurs, at least two different <unk> lizards, multiple <unk> fishes, a few <unk>, some frog specimens, and also <unk>. However, a large amount of the material of the Kirkwood formation only includes isolated teeth or partial and fragmentary pieces of bone. Dinosaurs of the formation include a basal tetanuran and the primitive <unk> <unk>, the possible <unk> <unk> and a potential <unk>, and many ornithischians, Paranthodon, a genus of <unk>, and a " <unk> " ( the family <unk> is no longer considered to be a natural grouping ).

The Royal Navy battleships Queen, Triumph, Prince of Wales, London, and <unk>, the cruiser <unk>, seven destroyers and four transport ships led the way carrying the 3rd Brigade.

At 02 : 00 a Turkish <unk> reported seeing ships moving at sea, and at 02 : 30 the report was sent to 9th Division's headquarters. At 02 : 53 the ships headed towards the peninsula, continuing until 03 : 30 when the larger ships stopped. With 50 yards ( 46 m ) to go, the rowing boats continued using only their oars. 
<|endoftext|> Around 04 : 30 Turkish <unk> opened fire on the boats, but the first ANZAC troops were already ashore at Beach Z, called Ari Burnu at the time, but later known as Anzac Cove. ( It was formally renamed Anzac Cove by the Turkish government in 1985. ) They were one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) further north than intended, and instead of an open beach they were faced with steep cliffs and ridges up to around three hundred feet ( 91 m ) in height. However, the mistake had put them ashore at a relatively undefended area ; at Gaba Tepe further south where they had planned to land, there was a strong @-@ point, with an artillery battery close by equipped with two 15 cm and two 12 cm guns, and the 5th Company, 27th Infantry Regiment was positioned to counter @-@ attack any landing at that more southern point. The hills surrounding the <unk> where the ANZACs landed made the beach safe from direct fire Turkish artillery. Fifteen minutes after the landing, the Royal Navy began firing at targets in the hills. 
<|endoftext|> On their way in, the rowing boats had become mixed up. The 11th Battalion grounded to the north of Ari Burnu point, while the 9th Battalion hit the point or just south of it, together with most of the 10th Battalion. The plan was for them to cross the open ground and assault the first ridge line, but they were faced with a hill that came down almost to the water line, and there was confusion while the officers tried to work out their location, under small arms fire from the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry Regiment, who had a platoon of between eighty and ninety men at Anzac Cove and a second platoon in the north around the Fisherman's Hut. The third platoon was in a reserve position on the second ridge. They also manned the Gaba Tepe strong @-@ point, equipped with two obsolescent multi @-@ <unk> <unk> machine @-@ guns, and several smaller posts in the south. 
<|endoftext|> Men from the 9th and 10th Battalions started up the Ari Burnu slope, grabbing the gorse branches or digging their bayonets into the soil to provide leverage. At the peak they found an abandoned trench, the Turks having withdrawn inland. Soon the Australians reached Plugge's Plateau, the edge of which was defended by a trench, but the Turks had withdrawn to the next summit two hundred yards ( 180 m ) inland, from where they fired at the Australians coming onto the plateau. As they arrived, Major Edmund Brockman of the 11th Battalion started sorting out the mess, sending the 9th Battalion's men to the right flank, the 11th Battalion's to the left, and keeping the 10th Battalion in the centre.

Borgnine was a guitar player in real life, so he brought his own guitar with him to the recording studio. Borgnine apologized because he felt that he was not being able to sing very well, but Nancy Cartwright, who provides the voice of Bart, thought his voice " added to the authenticity of his character ".

Because of this, ICP felt that The Tempest was missing the collaborative element that they felt made their earlier albums enjoyable.

Joseph Bruce ( <unk> J ) said that The Tempest is a concept album in its own right. Bruce describes the album's concept as relating to both a violent storm which turns into a tornado and pulls people into a hurricane as well as a roller coaster. According to Bruce, " That's a lot like riding on a violent roller coaster, I 'd assume. You get <unk> to the left, <unk> to the right, sucked way up into the sky, and then you go shooting down to the floor, and then you <unk> up to the left and then you whip around to the right. Well, The Tempest is a storm in the form of a roller coaster. " As a result of this concept, the album focuses on a variety of different moods. 
<|endoftext|> The Tempest maintains much of the <unk> lyrical content ICP is known for, as well as their humorous perspective. Unlike previous albums, this album does not contain any <unk> aimed at other <unk> or music industry figures. Bruce and Joseph Utsler ( Shaggy 2 Dope )'s rapping on this album is described by Allmusic reviewer David Jeffries as being delivered in " a carnival <unk> fashion that fits with their circus motif ", and contrasted Bruce and Utsler themselves as being like " Alice Cooper with a <unk> attitude ". 
<|endoftext|> The lyrics of " Growing Again ", which describes <unk> J growing into a giant, were inspired by Bruce's weight gain ; Bruce also says that the song reflects the feeling of being able to " rap about anything we want [... ] I feel we have the right for some songs to be softer and not about killing or Dark Carnival.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The most noted prerogative power that affects the judicial system is the prerogative of mercy, which has two elements : the granting of <unk> and the granting of <unk> <unk>. <unk> may eliminate the " pains, penalties and punishments " from a criminal conviction, though they do not remove convictions themselves. This power is commonly exercised on the advice of the Secretary of State for the Home Department ; the monarch has no direct involvement in its use. <unk> of this power may also take the form of <unk>, a limited form of pardon where the sentences is reduced, on certain conditions. The granting of a pardon is not subject to judicial review, as confirmed by Council of Civil Service <unk> v Minister for the Civil Service, but the courts have chosen to <unk> its application or lack <unk>, as in R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex parte Bentley. <unk> <unk> <unk> is done by the Attorney General of England and Wales ( or the equivalent in Scotland or Northern Ireland ) in the name of the crown, to stop legal proceedings against an individual. This is not <unk> by the courts, as confirmed by R v Comptroller of Patents, and does not count as an <unk> ; the defendant may be brought before the courts on the same charge at a later date. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Foreign affairs = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The royal prerogative is in much use in the realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states ( although several statutes regulate the <unk> enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives ), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to annex territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of <unk>. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as to the extent to which the government will take over the former government's <unk> ; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold <unk> Company v The King. The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her freedom to do these things in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of <unk> was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power : in R ( <unk> ) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs ( No 2 ), the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders @-@ in @-@ Council to <unk> judicial <unk> was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned. 
<|endoftext|> British passports are also issued under the prerogative, though these are also covered by statute law. Under the common law, citizens have the right freely to leave and enter the United Kingdom. In R v Foreign Secretary ex parte Everett, the courts held that it was their right to review the granting of passports to, and the <unk> of passports from, British citizens. The writ of ne <unk> <unk> is also used to prevent a person leaving the country. The right to make treaties is a disputed prerogative power : under Blackstone's definition, a prerogative power must be one unique to the monarch. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Other prerogative powers = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The monarch also has power to exercise her prerogative over the granting of honours, the regulation of the armed forces and ecclesiastical appointments. Although the granting of most honours is normally decided by the executive, the monarch is still the person who technically awards them. <unk> to this rule are membership of the Order of the Garter, the Order of the <unk>, the Order of Merit, the Royal Victorian Order and the Royal Victorian Chain, which the monarch has complete discretion to grant. In relation to the armed forces, the monarch is the Commander in Chief, and members are regulated under the royal prerogative. Most statutes do not apply to the armed forces, although some areas, such as military discipline, are governed by Acts of Parliament. Under the Crown Proceedings Act 1947, the monarch is the sole authority for the armed forces, and as such their organisation, disposition and control cannot be questioned by the courts. This exercise of prerogative power gives the Crown authority to recruit members of the armed forces, appoint commissioned officers, and establish agreements with foreign governments to station troops in their territory. The prerogative <unk> the monarch to appoint bishops and archbishops in the Church of England, and to regulate the printing and licensing of the authorised Church of England version of the Bible.

Wanyan Liang presented himself as a Chinese emperor, and planned to unite China by conquering the Song. In <unk>, Wanyan Liang provided a <unk> <unk> by announcing that the Song had broken the 1142 peace treaty by acquiring horses. He instituted an unpopular draft that was the source of widespread unrest in the empire. Anti @-@ Jin <unk> erupted among the Khitans and in Jin provinces bordering the Song. Wanyan Liang did not allow dissent, and opposition to the war was severely punished. The Song had been notified beforehand of Wanyan Liang's plan. They prepared by securing their defenses along the border, mainly near the Yangtze River, but were hampered by Emperor Gaozong's <unk>. Gaozong's desire for peace made him <unk> to provoking the Jin. Wanyan Liang began the invasion in 1161 without formally declaring war. Jurchen armies personally led by Wanyan Liang left Kaifeng on October 15, reached the Huai River border on October 28, and marched in the direction of the Yangtze. The Song lost the Huai to the Jurchens but captured a few Jin prefectures in the west, slowing the Jurchen advance. A group of Jurchen generals were sent to cross the Yangtze near the city of Caishi ( south of Ma <unk> in modern Anhui ) while Wanyan Liang established a base near Yangzhou. 
<|endoftext|> The Song official Yu <unk> was in command of the army defending the river. The Jurchen army was defeated while attacking Caishi between November 26 and 27 during the Battle of Caishi. The <unk> @-@ wheel ships of the Song navy, armed with <unk> that fired gunpowder bombs, overwhelmed the light ships of the Jin fleet. Jin ships were unable to compete because they were smaller and hastily constructed. The bombs launched by the Song contained mixtures of gunpowder, lime, scraps of iron, and a poison that was likely arsenic. Traditional Chinese accounts consider this the turning point of the war, characterizing it as a military upset that secured southern China from the northern invaders. The significance of the battle is said to have rivaled a similarly revered victory at the Battle of Fei River in the 4th century. Contemporaneous Song accounts claimed that the 18 @,@ 000 Song soldiers commanded by Yu <unk> and tasked with defending Caishi were able to defeat the invading Jurchen army of 400 @,@ 000 soldiers. Modern historians are more skeptical and consider the Jurchen numbers an exaggeration. Song historians may have confused the number of Jurchen soldiers at the Battle of Caishi with the total number of soldiers under the command of Wanyan Liang. The conflict was not the one @-@ sided battle that traditional accounts imply, and the Song had numerous advantages over the Jin. The Song fleet was larger than the Jin's, and the Jin were unable to use their greatest asset, cavalry, in a naval battle.

The first @-@ detected invasive mole cricket species was Neoscapteriscus didactylus, a South American species reported as a pest in St. Vincent, West Indies as early as 1837 ; by 1900, it was a major pest of agriculture in Puerto Rico. It had probably slowly expanded its range northwards, island by island, from South America. The only biological control program against N. didactylus was in Puerto Rico, and it succeeded in establishing the <unk> wasp Larra bicolor from <unk> Brazil. In 2001, N. didactylus in Puerto Rico seemed to be a pest only in irrigated crops and turf. Small scale experimental applications of the nematode Steinernema scapterisci were made in irrigated turf, but survival of the nematode was poor. Very much later, this same species was reported as a pest in Queensland, Australia, presumably arriving by ship or plane. The next @-@ detected invasive species was in the late 19th century in Hawaii, probably by ship. It was named as Gryllotalpa africana, but was probably G. orientalis. It attacked sugarcane and was targeted with Larra <unk> from the Philippines in 1925, apparently successfully.

Especially to aid Florida ranchers, a project that became known as the <unk> / <unk> Mole Cricket Research Program was initiated in 1978. In 1985, a multi @-@ authored report was published on accomplishments. In 1988, an account was published on prospects for biological control, and in 1996 an account of promising results with biological control. The program ended in 2004 after 25 years of running monitoring stations, and in 2006 a summary publication announced success : a 95 % reduction in mole cricket numbers in northern Florida, with biological control agents spreading potentially to all parts of Florida. Efforts to use Larra bicolor as a biological control agent in Florida began by <unk> a stock from Puerto Rico. It became established in a small area of southeastern Florida but had little effect on Neoscapteriscus populations. A stock from Bolivia became established in northern Florida and spread widely ( with some help ) to most of the rest of the state and neighboring states. Its survival depends upon the availability of suitable nectar sources.

That intensity was maintained until late on October 31, when Tanya began to weaken as it traveled over cooler waters and the eye became obscured. Early on November 1, Tanya began to lose tropical characteristics while still a hurricane. Hurricane Tanya was also heading rapidly northeast towards the Azores at the time. Tanya was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm on November 1. Despite weakening, the wind field of Tanya became larger. That evening, Tanya was declared fully extratropical as it passed the Azores. The remnant cyclone turned north, before being absorbed by another extratropical cyclone early on November 3.

The Azores were hit very hard by the storm, which had just been declared extratropical when it hit the region. Damage was particularly severe on the islands of <unk>, <unk>, <unk> and São Jorge. Extensive property damage was reported, including many sunk boats, many houses were damaged and some destroyed and significant agricultural damage. Many trees and power lines were also knocked down, cutting electricity and hampering communications in the area. The highest wind gusts reported in the Azores were around 105 mph ( 170 km / h ). After the storm, a resolution was submitted to the European Parliament by the Government of Portugal and a disaster area was declared in the islands. One Spanish fisherman drowned and several people were injured.

Hurricane Alice developed in late December 1954, but persisted into January 1955, and was operationally analysed to have developed in the latter. Within the official hurricane season bounds, tropical cyclogenesis did not occur until July 31, with the development of Tropical Storm Brenda. However, during the month of August, four tropical cyclones formed – including Connie, Diane, Edith, and an unnamed tropical storm. Five additional tropical cyclones – Flora, Gladys, Hilda, Ione, and Janet – all developed in September. Tropical cyclogenesis briefly halted until an unnamed tropical storm formed on October 10. The final storm of the season, Katie, dissipated on October 19, almost a month before the official end of hurricane season on November 15.

According to <unk> folklore, all foxes have the ability to shape shift into men or women. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others — as foxes in folklore often do — other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, lovers, and wives. 
<|endoftext|> Foxes and human beings lived close together in ancient Japan ; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with Inari, a Shinto kami or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> During his first season in the NBA, Jordan averaged 28 @.@ 2 ppg on 51 @.@ 5 % shooting. He quickly became a fan favorite even in opposing arenas, and appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with the heading " A Star Is Born " just over a month into his professional career. Jordan was also voted in as an All @-@ Star starter by the fans in his rookie season. Controversy arose before the All @-@ Star game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, were upset by the amount of attention Jordan was receiving. This led to a so @-@ called " freeze @-@ out " on Jordan, where players refused to pass him the ball throughout the game. The controversy left Jordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular season play, and he would go on to be voted Rookie of the Year. The Bulls finished the season 38 – 44, and lost in the first round of the playoffs in four games to the Milwaukee <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Jordan's second season was cut short by a broken foot in the third game of the season, which caused him to miss 64 games. Despite Jordan's injury and a 30 – 52 record ( at the time it was fifth worst record of any team to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history ),
<|endoftext|> believed that he had observed new cells assembling around " <unk> ". Franz <unk> was a strong opponent of this view, having already described cells <unk> by division and believing that many cells would have no nuclei. The idea that cells can be generated de <unk>, by the " <unk> " or otherwise, contradicted work by Robert <unk> ( 1852 ) and Rudolf Virchow ( 1855 ) who decisively <unk> the new paradigm that cells are generated solely by cells ( " <unk> <unk> e <unk> " ). The function of the nucleus remained unclear. 
<|endoftext|> Between 1877 and 1878, Oscar <unk> published several studies on the fertilization of sea <unk> eggs, showing that the nucleus of the sperm enters the <unk> and fuses with its nucleus. This was the first time it was suggested that an individual develops from a ( single ) nucleated cell. This was in contradiction to Ernst <unk>'s theory that the complete phylogeny of a species would be repeated during embryonic development, including generation of the first nucleated cell from a " <unk> ", a <unk> mass of primordial <unk> ( " <unk> " ). Therefore, the necessity of the sperm nucleus for fertilization was discussed for quite some time. However, <unk> confirmed his observation in other animal groups, including amphibians and molluscs. Eduard <unk> produced the same results for plants in 1884. This paved the way to assign the nucleus an important role in heredity. In 1873, August <unk> postulated the equivalence of the maternal and paternal <unk> cells for heredity. The function of the nucleus as carrier of genetic information became clear only later, after mitosis was discovered and the <unk> rules were rediscovered at the beginning of the 20th century ; the chromosome theory of heredity was therefore developed. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Structures = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The nucleus is the largest cellular organelle in animal cells. In mammalian cells, the average diameter of the nucleus is approximately 6 micrometres ( µm ), which occupies about 10 % of the total cell volume. The <unk> liquid within it is called nucleoplasm, and is similar in composition to the <unk> found outside the nucleus. It appears as a dense, roughly spherical or irregular organelle. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Nuclear envelope and pores = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The nuclear envelope, otherwise known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged parallel to one another and separated by 10 to 50 <unk> ( nm ). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from <unk> freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the <unk> space and is continuous with the <unk> <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Nuclear pores, which provide <unk> channels through the envelope, are composed of multiple proteins, collectively referred to as <unk>. The pores are about 125 million <unk> in molecular weight and consist of around 50 ( in yeast ) to several hundred proteins ( in vertebrates ). The pores are 100 nm in total diameter ; however, the gap through which molecules freely diffuse is only about 9 nm wide, due to the presence of regulatory systems within the center of the pore. This size selectively allows the passage of small water @-@ soluble molecules while preventing larger molecules, such as nucleic acids and larger proteins, from <unk> entering or exiting the nucleus. These large molecules must be actively transported into the nucleus instead. The nucleus of a typical mammalian cell will have about 3000 to 4000 pores throughout its envelope, each of which contains an <unk> @-@ <unk> ring @-@ shaped structure at a position where the inner and outer membranes fuse. Attached to the ring is a structure called the nuclear basket that extends into the nucleoplasm, and a series of <unk> extensions that reach into the cytoplasm. Both structures serve to mediate binding to nuclear transport proteins. 
<|endoftext|> Most proteins, ribosomal subunits, and some <unk> are transported through the pore complexes in a process mediated by a family of transport factors known as karyopherins. Those karyopherins that mediate movement into the nucleus are also called importins, whereas those that mediate movement out of the nucleus are called exportins. Most karyopherins interact directly with their cargo, although some use <unk> proteins. <unk> hormones such as <unk

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In late 1943, Hitler placed Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in charge of improving the coastal defences along the Atlantic Wall in anticipation of an Allied invasion, expected to take place sometime in 1944. Rommel believed that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In the immediate area of Gold, between Le Hamel and La Rivière, seven defensive <unk> designed to hold 50 men apiece were constructed. Two major concrete @-@ reinforced coastal artillery emplacements ( a battery of four 122 mm guns at Mont Fleury and the Longues @-@ sur @-@ Mer battery, with four 150 mm guns ) were only partially completed by D @-@ Day.

<|endoftext|> Hitler gave Rommel command of the newly re @-@ formed Army Group B, which included the 7th Army, the 15th Army, and the forces guarding the Netherlands.

<|endoftext|> Kleinman contacted a pair of Canadian graphic novel artists to begin the <unk> process. <unk> the commercial meant that the agency could determine how much of the £ <unk> budget to <unk> to each section, and provided them with visuals to use as part of the presentation to Diageo when pitching the various concepts for a decision on which to pursue.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Production = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Production of the commercial took place over two months, with principal photography shot in Iceland. Time @-@ lapse photographs were taken of the country's <unk>, volcanic terrain and frozen lakes using 35 mm film cameras. The shooting was done in the early summer for the nearly continuous daylight that the season afforded them. The next pieces of the commercial to be assembled were the live @-@ action segments, shot in a <unk> studio in London. Filming was done in three stages, with the three actors changing into different sets of prosthetic makeup at each stage. For the final section the actors spent a week <unk> the choreography behind walking backwards with an appropriately <unk> gait. <unk> were attached to the back of each actor, allowing them to lean forwards to give the impression that they were being " sucked back in time " when the final cut was put together. While filming the actor sequences, VFX supervisor William Bartlett filmed the aerial view of London from Tower 42's Vertigo bar. 
<|endoftext|> With computer @-@ generated imagery looking to make up so much of the commercial, Kleinman attempted to use film of real elements wherever possible. To this end, 200 mudskippers were brought to the studio from South Africa for the final scene, arriving via Singapore. An entire afternoon was set aside for filming the <unk> sequence. The footage obtained formed the major part of the final cut of the scene, with only one or two post @-@ production changes : the addition of tail fins and animation of the expression of disgust that closes the piece. Stop motion footage of other real elements was taken, including a stage @-@ by @-@ stage <unk> of plants, used to show flora coming back to life in the reverse sequence, and shots of baking bread, used to model the geological changes to background rock formations.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In May 1963, Dylan's political profile rose when he walked out of The Ed Sullivan Show. During rehearsals, Dylan had been told by CBS television's head of program practices that " <unk>'John Birch <unk> Blues " was potentially <unk> to the John Birch Society. Rather than comply with censorship, Dylan refused to appear. 
<|endoftext|> By this time, Dylan and Baez were prominent in the civil rights movement, singing together at the March on Washington on August 28, 1963. Dylan's third album, The Times They Are a @-@ <unk> ', reflected a more <unk> and cynical Dylan. The songs often took as their subject matter contemporary stories, with " Only A <unk> In Their Game " addressing the murder of civil rights worker <unk> Evers ; and the <unk> " The <unk> Death of <unk> Carroll " the death of black hotel <unk> <unk> Carroll, at the hands of young white <unk> William <unk>. On a more general theme, " Ballad of Hollis Brown " and " North Country Blues " addressed despair engendered by the breakdown of farming and mining communities. This political material was accompanied by two personal love songs, " Boots of Spanish <unk> " and " One Too Many <unk> ". 
<|endoftext|> By the end of 1963, Dylan felt both manipulated and constrained by the folk and protest movements. Accepting the " Tom <unk> Award " from the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, an intoxicated Dylan questioned the role of the committee, characterized the members as old and <unk>, and claimed to see something of himself and of every man in Kennedy's assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald. 
<|endoftext|> Another Side of Bob Dylan, recorded on a single evening in June 1964, had a lighter mood. The humorous Dylan <unk> on " I <unk> Be Free No. 10 " and " <unk> Nightmare ". " Spanish Harlem Incident " and " To <unk> " are passionate love songs, while " Black Crow Blues " and " I Don 't Believe You ( She Acts Like We Never Have Met ) " suggest the rock and roll soon to dominate Dylan's music. " It Ain 't Me Babe ", on the surface a song about <unk> love, has been described as a rejection of the role of political spokesman thrust upon him. His newest direction was signaled by two lengthy songs : the <unk> " <unk> of Freedom ", which sets social commentary against a metaphorical landscape in a style characterized by Allen Ginsberg as " chains of flashing images, " and " My Back <unk> ", which attacks the simplistic and arch seriousness of his own earlier topical songs and seems to predict the backlash he was about to encounter from his former champions as he took a new direction. 
<|endoftext|> In the latter half of 1964 and 1965, Dylan moved from folk songwriter to folk @-@ rock pop @-@ music star. His <unk> and work shirts were replaced by a <unk> Street wardrobe, <unk> day or night, and pointed " <unk> boots ". A London reporter wrote : " Hair that would set the teeth of a comb on edge. A loud shirt that would dim the neon lights of Leicester Square. He looks like an <unk> <unk>. " Dylan began to spar with <unk>.

From 1972 to 1976, the company's revenue doubled, to NOK 500 million, while production increased 18 %.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Commercial enterprises = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The most important commercial enterprise in the early part of the territorial era was the lucrative fur trade. At the beginning of the 19th century two British companies competed for dominance in the North American trade : Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company. The North West company had used Grand Portage as its western headquarters along with other smaller companies that operated in the area. Grand Portage was one of the four principal British trading and shipping points furs in North America. Following the Treaty of Paris, in 1783, British operations at Grand Portage were technically illegal though the trade continued. However, beginning in 1801 the North West Company began re @-@ establishing its headquarters north of the border at the newly constructed Fort William in what is now Ontario. After 1804 Grand Portage had been reduced to a minor trading center and most traders eventually abandoned the area. In 1842, the Hudson Bay Company, which had by then absorbed the North West Company, shipped out a final band of Ojibwe who were employed by the company. 
<|endoftext|> Before 1816 the majority of the fur trading posts in the Minnesota area were owned by the North West Company, but by 1821 the American Fur Company, founded in 1808 by John Jacob Astor in New York, had taken over most of these. As well as Grand Portage, another significant fur shipping point in Minnesota was Fort Frances in the <unk> Lake region, near modern International Falls in the far north of the state. This location became significant as it was key to multiple waterways for shipping furs to the Atlantic. Both the North West Company and the American Fur Company had posts at this location. Pembina, originally part of the Red River Colony, was a significant trading post for the Hudson's Bay Company, and once it was claimed by the U.S., became for a time key to U.S. interests in the fur trade. By 1830 American Fur dominated the trade within the United States because of the exclusion of British companies by the U.S. government. 
<|endoftext|> Beginning in the 1820s, a fur trading route developed between the Red River Colony ( in modern Manitoba ) and the trading posts in Minnesota, first primarily at Mendota and later at Saint Paul. The system of <unk> cart trails came to be known as the Red River Trails and was used principally by the Métis as a way to avoid the fur trade monopoly of the Hudson's Bay Company ( which had absorbed the

In 1102 Anselm refused to consecrate three bishops, two of whom had received investiture from the king ; Gerard offered to consecrate them instead, but all except one refused. From 1105 onwards Gerard slowly began to embrace the papal position on investiture of bishops, which opposed <unk> investing bishops with the symbols of episcopal authority. As part of his change of position, Gerard withdrew from court to care for his diocese. Towards the end of 1105 Gerard attempted to join Bohemond of Antioch, who was assembling a <unk> force in France, but it appears that King Henry prevented Gerard's departure. In <unk> Gerard wrote to Bohemond that he was still preparing to go on crusade, but he never did. At about the same time, Gerard was working to find a mutually acceptable resolution to the Investiture Crisis, writing a number of letters and other works supporting Anselm's and the pope's position. By 1107 King Henry and Anselm had reached an agreement settling the dispute. 
<|endoftext|> Gerard agreed to a compromise on the matter of obedience to Anselm. King Henry proposed that Anselm accept a witnessed oath from Gerard that he would remain bound by the profession he made to Anselm on his consecration as Bishop of Hereford. Gerard made this oath at the Council of Westminster in 1107. It was a victory for Canterbury, but not a complete one, as Gerard avoided making a written profession, and it was specific to Gerard, not to his office. Gerard continued to oppose Anselm's attempts to assert Canterbury's primacy, but the two were reconciled before Gerard's death. 
<|endoftext|> Gerard also had an uneasy relationship with his cathedral chapter, after attempting to reform his cathedral clergy by forcing them to give up their wives and <unk> and become ordained priests. He wrote to Anselm in 1103 complaining of the <unk> of his clergy and <unk> Anselm's better relations with Canterbury's chapter, which was composed of monks instead of the secular canons who made up York Minster's chapter. In this correspondence, Gerard complained that some of the York canons refused to be ordained as priests, thereby hoping to avoid taking the vow of celibacy. He also accused them of accepting <unk> but refusing to live or work at the cathedral, and of focusing on a narrow legal definition of celibacy without actually being <unk>. The canons'argument was that they were only required not to maintain women in their own houses, but they were not forbidden to visit or entertain women in houses belonging to others. It was not only Gerard who complained about the relationship between him and his canons ; the latter accused Gerard of <unk> York by making gifts of lands to others.

" Of course, the nightingale's song is the dominant image and dominant " voice " within the ode. The nightingale is also the object of empathy and praise within the poem. However, the nightingale and the discussion of the nightingale is not simply about the bird or the song, but about human experience in general. This is not to say that the song is a simple metaphor, but it is a complex image that is formed through the interaction of the conflicting voices of praise and questioning. On this theme, David Perkins <unk> the way " Ode to a Nightingale " and " Ode on a Grecian Urn " perform this when he says, " we are dealing with a talent, indeed an entire approach to poetry, in which symbol, however necessary, may possibly not satisfy as the principal concern of poetry, any more than it could with Shakespeare, but is rather an element in the poetry and drama of human reactions ". However, there is a difference between an urn and a nightingale in that the nightingale is not an eternal entity. Furthermore, in creating any aspect of the nightingale immortal during the poem the narrator separates any union that he can have with the nightingale. 
<|endoftext|> The nightingale's song within the poem is connected to the art of music in a way that the urn in " Ode on a Grecian Urn " is connected to the art of sculpture. As such, the nightingale would represent an <unk> presence and, unlike the urn, is directly connected to nature. As natural music, the song is for beauty and lacks a message of truth. Keats follows Coleridge's belief, as found in " The Nightingale ", in separating from the world by losing himself in the bird's song. Although Keats favours a female nightingale over Coleridge's masculine bird, both reject the traditional depiction of the nightingale as related to the tragedy of <unk>. Their <unk> is a happy nightingale that lacks the melancholic feel of previous poetic depictions. The bird is only a voice within the poem, but it is a voice that <unk> the narrator to join with in and forget the <unk> of the world. However, there is tension in that the narrator holds Keats's guilt regarding the death of Tom Keats, his brother. The song's conclusion represents the result of trying to escape into the realm of fancy. 
<|endoftext|> Like Percy <unk> Shelley ’ s " To a <unk> ", Keats ’ s narrator listens to a bird song, but listening to the song within “ Ode to a Nightingale ” is almost painful and similar to death. The narrator seeks to be with the nightingale and abandons his sense of vision in order to embrace the sound in an attempt to share in the darkness with the bird. As the poem ends, the trance caused by the nightingale is broken and the narrator is left wondering if it was a real vision or just a dream. The poem reliance on the process of sleeping common to Keats's poems, and " Ode to a Nightingale " shares many of the same themes as Keats's Sleep and Poetry and Eve of St. Agnes. This further separates the image of the nightingale's song from its closest comparative image, the urn as represented in " Ode on a Grecian Urn ". The nightingale is distant and mysterious, and even disappears at the end of the poem. The dream image emphasizes the <unk> and <unk> of the poem. These elements make it impossible for there to be a complete self @-@ identification with the nightingale, but it also allows for self @-@ awareness to <unk> throughout the poem, albeit in an altered state. 
<|endoftext|> Midway through the poem, there is a split between the two actions of the poem : the first attempts to identify with the nightingale and its song, and the second discusses the convergence of the past with the future while experiencing the present. This second theme is reminiscent of Keats's view of human progression through the Mansion of Many Apartments and how man develops from experiencing and wanting only pleasure to understanding truth as a mixture of both pleasure and pain. The <unk> fields and the nightingale's song in the first half of the poem represent the <unk> moments that overwhelm the individual like a drug. However, the experience does not last forever, and the body is left <unk> it until the narrator feels helpless without the pleasure. Instead of embracing the coming truth, the narrator clings to poetry to hide from the loss of pleasure. Poetry does not

Schedeen felt that there was a lack of connections between the Ruwan plot and the Master Chief's adventures, which was never satisfactorily resolved. The comic's focus on Ruwan and <unk>'s subplot was also seen as a major fault : Comics Bulletin's Geoff Collins, in a review of the second issue, said that " as a comic book fan I ’ m interested [ in Ruwan and <unk> ], but the Halo fans I know could [ sic ] care less about them. And the story in this issue centers around them. " Schedeen was surprised to find that he only began to care about them in the final issue.

Schedeen summed up his reviews by saying that he was hopeful the production teams behind the upcoming Halo books " will learn from the mistakes made here and craft stories that can consistently capture what makes Halo fun.

Development of the floodplain has led to increasing amounts of people and infrastructure within areas at high risk of inundation. <unk> have been constructed along more than a third of the river in order to keep <unk> within the channel, but with the consequences of faster stream velocity and a resulting increase of peak flows in downstream areas. <unk> runoff, which causes elevated levels of nitrogen and other nutrients, is a major problem along the Missouri River, especially in Iowa and Missouri. This form of pollution also heavily affects the upper Mississippi, Illinois and Ohio Rivers. Low oxygen levels in rivers and the vast Gulf of Mexico dead zone at the end of the Mississippi Delta are both results of high nutrient concentrations in the Missouri and other tributaries of the Mississippi. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> of the lower Missouri waters has made the river narrower, deeper and less accessible to riparian flora and fauna. Numerous dams and bank stabilization projects have been constructed to facilitate the conversion of 300 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 200 km2 ) of Missouri River floodplain to agricultural land. Channel control has significantly reduced the volume of sediment transported downstream by the river and eliminated critical habitat for fish, birds and amphibians. By the early 21st century, declines in populations of native species prompted the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to issue a biological opinion recommending restoration of river habitats for <unk> endangered bird and fish species. 
<|endoftext|> The USACE began work on ecosystem restoration projects along the lower Missouri River in the early 21st century. Because of the low use of the shipping channel in the lower Missouri maintained by the USACE, it is now considered feasible to remove some of the levees, <unk>, and wing dams that <unk> the river's flow, thus allowing it to naturally restore its banks.

The report found that a better understanding of sediment processes in the Missouri River, including the creation of a " sediment budget " – an accounting of sediment transport, erosion, and deposition volumes for the length of the Missouri River – would provide a foundation for projects to improve water quality standards and protect endangered species.

This 100 @-@ kilometer @-@ thick mantle ( 23 % – 28 % of Ceres by mass ; 50 % by volume ) contains up to 200 million cubic kilometers of water, which would be more than the amount of fresh water on Earth. This result is supported by the observations made by the Keck telescope in 2002 and by evolutionary modeling. Also, some characteristics of its surface and history ( such as its distance from the Sun, which weakened solar radiation enough to allow some fairly low @-@ freezing @-@ point components to be incorporated during its formation ), point to the presence of volatile materials in the interior of Ceres. It has been suggested that a remnant layer of liquid water may have survived to the present under a layer of ice. Measurements taken by Dawn confirm that Ceres is both differentiated and has a shape consistent with hydrostatic equilibrium, which makes Ceres the smallest object confirmed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium, being 600 km smaller and less than half the mass of Saturn's moon Rhea, the next smallest such object. <unk> has suggested Ceres could have a small metallic core from partial differentiation of its rocky fraction.

Water ice can migrate from the deep layers of Ceres to the surface, but escapes in a very short time. As a result, it is difficult to detect water <unk>. Water escaping from polar regions of Ceres was possibly observed in the early 1990s but this has not been unambiguously demonstrated. It may be possible to detect escaping water from the surroundings of a fresh impact crater or from cracks in the subsurface layers of Ceres. <unk> observations by the <unk> spacecraft detected statistically significant amounts of hydroxide ions near Ceres'north pole, which is a product of water vapor <unk> by ultraviolet solar radiation.

" Alone amongst modern writers, Adorján claims that White starts the game with essentially no advantage. He writes, " In my opinion, the only obvious advantage for White is that if he or she plays for a draw, and does so well, then Black can hardly avoid this without taking obvious risks. " Adorján goes so far as to claim that, " The tale of White's advantage is a delusion, belief in it is based on mass <unk>. " Rowson writes that Adorján's " contention is one of the most important chess ideas of the last two decades... because it has shaken our assumption that White begins the game with some advantage, and revealed its ideological nature ".

" Evans wrote that after one of his games against Fischer, " Fischer <unk> his'secret'to me : unlike other masters, he sought to win with the Black pieces from the start. The revelation that Black has dynamic chances and need not be satisfied with mere equality was the turning point in his career, he said. " Likewise, Watson surmised that Kasparov, when playing Black, bypasses the question of whether White has an opening advantage " by thinking in terms of the concrete nature of the dynamic imbalance on the board, and seeking to seize the initiative whenever possible ". Watson observes that " energetic opening play by Black may... lead to a position so complex and unclear that to speak of equality is meaningless. Sometimes we say'dynamically balanced'instead of'equal'to express the view that either player is as likely as the other to emerge from complications with an advantage. This style of opening play has become prevalent in modern chess, with World Champions Fischer and Kasparov as its most visible practitioners. " 
<|endoftext|> Modern writers also question the idea that White has an enduring advantage. Suba, in his influential 1991 book Dynamic Chess Strategy, rejects the notion that the initiative can always be transformed into an enduring advantage. He contends that sometimes the player with the initiative loses it with no logical explanation, and that, " Sometimes you must lose it, just like that.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Nirvana first played the song the night before it was <unk>. <unk> <unk> Novoselic recalled that it " originally sounded like a Bad Brains song. Then Kurt turned it into a pop song ". Cobain went home and reworked the song, playing the revised version of it over the phone to Novoselic. The band recorded " In Bloom " with producer Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin during April 1990. The material recorded at Smart Studios was intended for the group's second album for the independent record label Sub Pop. The song originally had a bridge section that Vig removed. Novoselic said that after the band recorded the song, Vig cut out the bridge from the 16 @-@ track master tape with a razor blade and threw it in the garbage. The songs from these sessions were placed on a demo tape that circulated amongst the music industry, generating interest in the group among major record labels. 
<|endoftext|> After signing to <unk> Records, Nirvana began recording its second album Nevermind in May 1991. " In Bloom " was one of the first songs the band recorded during the album sessions at Sound City Studios in Van <unk>, California ; Vig thought it would be good to start recording a song previously recorded at Smart Studios. The arrangements for " In Bloom " and the other songs previously recorded with Vig in 1990 were largely unchanged ; the recently hired drummer Dave Grohl stayed mostly with what his predecessor Chad Channing had recorded, but added more power and precision to the recording. Cobain sang progressively " harder " during the recording of the song, which made it difficult for Vig to balance the volume levels between the verses and choruses. Vig recalled that he had to change the input level " on the fly " and hoped that Cobain would not " change the <unk> or do something different " while recording. 
<|endoftext|> Cobain chose not to <unk> a harmony vocal part during the Smart Studios sessions, possibly due to time constraints. During the Nevermind sessions, Vig had Grohl sing harmonies on the song. Grohl had difficulty hitting the proper notes, but ultimately was able to sing what Vig wanted. Vig often had to trick Cobain, who was <unk> to performing multiple takes, into recording additional takes for overdubs on the record. The producer convinced Cobain to double @-@ track his vocals on " In Bloom " by telling him, " John Lennon did it. " After doubling Cobain's vocals, Vig decided he might as well double Grohl's and had the drummer record an additional track of backing harmonies.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Like many Nirvana songs, " In Bloom " shifts back and forth between quiet verses and loud choruses. Cobain uses a Mesa Boogie guitar amplifier for the verses, and during the chorus he switches to a Fender <unk> <unk> ( suggested by Vig ) for a heavier, double @-@ tracked <unk> sound. The rhythm section of Novoselic and Grohl kept its parts simple ; Grohl stated it was " an unspoken rule " to avoid unnecessary drum fills, while Novoselic said he felt his role was about " serving the song ". During the choruses, vocalist Cobain and drummer Grohl <unk> while singing " He's the one / Who likes all our pretty songs / And he likes to sing along / And he likes to shoot his gun / But he knows not what it means ". The song's intro reappears at the end of each chorus. 
<|endoftext|> Cobain's lyrics address the people outside of the underground music scene that began showing up at Nirvana shows after the release of the group's debut album <unk>. Nirvana biographer Michael <unk> wrote, " But remarkably, [ the song's lyrics ] translated even better to the mass popularity the band enjoyed. " Regarding the song's chorus, <unk> commented, " The brilliant irony is that the tune is so catchy that millions of people actually do sing along to it. " In his biography of Cobain, <unk> Than Heaven, Charles R. Cross asserted that the song was a " thinly disguised portrait " of Cobain's friend Dylan Carlson.

<|endoftext|> Relay races emerged in the United States in the 1880s as a variation on charity races between <unk>, who would hand a red pennant on to team mates every 300 yards. There are two very common relay events : the 4 × 100 metres relay and the 4 × 400 metres relay. Both events entered the Olympic programme at the 1912 Summer Games after a one @-@ off men's medley relay featured in 1908 Olympics. The 4 × 100 m event is run strictly within the same lane on the track, meaning that the team collectively runs one complete circuit of the track. Teams in a 4 × 400 m event remain in their own lane until the runner of the second leg passes the first bend, at which point runners can leave their lanes and head towards the inner @-@ most part of the circuit. For the second and third baton change overs, team mates must align themselves in respect of their team position – leading teams take the inner lanes while team mates of the slower teams must await the baton on outer lanes. 
<|endoftext|> The IAAF keeps world records for five different types of track relays. As with 4 × 100 m and 4 × 400 m events, all races comprise teams of four athletes running the same distances, with the less commonly contested distances being the 4 × 200 m, 4 × 800 m and 4 × 1500 m relays. Other events include the distance medley relay ( comprising legs of 1200 m, 400 m, 800 m, and 1600 m ), which is frequently held in the United States, and a sprint relay, known as the Swedish medley relay, which is popular in Scandinavia and held at the World Youth Championships in Athletics programme. Relay events have significant participation in the United States, where a number of large meetings ( or relay carnivals ) are focused almost exclusively on relay events.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Races with hurdles as obstacles were first popularised in the 19th century in England. The first known event, held in 1830, was a variation of the 100 @-@ yard dash that included heavy wooden barriers as obstacles. A competition between the Oxford and Cambridge Athletic <unk> in 1864 refined this, holding a 120 @-@ yard race ( 110 m ) with ten hurdles of 3 @-@ foot and 6 inches ( 1 @.@ 06 m ) in height ( each placed 10 yards ( 9 m ) apart ), with the first and final hurdles 15 yards from the start and finish, respectively. French organisers adapted the race into metric ( adding 28 cm ) and the <unk> of this race, the men's 110 metres hurdles, has remained largely unchanged. The origin of the 400 metres hurdles also lies in Oxford, where ( around 1860 ) a competition was held over 440 yards and twelve 1 @.@ 06 m high wooden barriers were placed along the course. The modern regulations stem from the 1900 Summer Olympics : the distance was fixed to 400 m while ten 3 @-@ foot ( 91 @.@ 44 cm ) hurdles were placed 35 m apart on the track, with the first and final hurdles being 45 m and 40 m away from the start and finish, respectively. Women's hurdles are slightly lower at 84 cm ( 2 ft 9 in ) for the 100 m event and 76 cm ( 2 ft 6 in ) for the 400 m event. 
<|endoftext|> By far the most common events are the 100 metres hurdles for women, 110 m hurdles for men and 400 m hurdles for both sexes. The men's 110 m has been featured at every modern Summer Olympics while the men's 400 m was introduced in the second edition of the Games. Women's initially competed in the 80 metres hurdles event, which entered the Olympic programme in 1932. This was extended to the 100 m hurdles at the 1972 Olympics, but it was not until 1984 that a women's 400 m hurdles event took place at the Olympics ( having been introduced at the 1983 World Championships in Athletics the previous year ). 
<|endoftext|> Outside of the hurdles events, the steeplechase race is the other track and field event with obstacles. Just as the hurdling events, the steeplechase finds its origin in student competition in Oxford, England. However, this event was born as a human variation on the original steeplechase competition found in horse racing. A steeplechase event was held on a track for the 1879 English championships and the 1900 Summer Olympics featured men's 2500 m and 4000 m steeplechase races. The event was held over various distances until the 1920 Summer Olympics marked the rise of the

<|endoftext|> NC State went three and out after receiving the ball, and after Tech incurred a running into the kicker penalty on the first punt attempt, NC State punted the ball away. After the kick, Tech took over on offense at its 27 @-@ yard line. On Tech's first play after the punt, however, Hunter fumbled the ball after a 10 @-@ yard rush. NC State recovered the ball, and the Wolfpack offense returned to the field at the Tech 40 @-@ yard line. On their first play after the fumble recover, Kramer completed a 12 @-@ yard pass to Worthen for a first down. During the next play, Kramer fumbled the ball while attempting to run with it, and Virginia Tech's defense recovered. This allowed the Tech offense to return to the field and attempt another offensive drive beginning at their 27 @-@ yard line. 
<|endoftext|> Tech picked up a first down, then Chapman was forced to scramble for a first down after facing third and 10. Stopped inches short of gaining the first down, Tech risked turning the ball over by attempting to convert the fourth down. Unlike their previous try in the game, Tech was successful and the Hokies'drive continued. Tech continued to pick up yardage and first downs, advancing deep into the NC State side of the field. Inside the State 30 @-@ yard line, Tech quarterback Chapman was sacked for a 10 @-@ yard loss. He responded by throwing a 30 @-@ yard pass on the next play, driving Virginia Tech inside the State one @-@ yard line. Williams rushed into the end zone with 33 seconds remaining in the quarter, cutting the Wolfpack lead to 21 – 16. Virginia Tech elected to attempt a two @-@ point conversion, which was unsuccessful. 
<|endoftext|> NC State received Tech's post @-@ touchdown kickoff and returned the ball to their 32 @-@ yard line. The Wolfpack offense had time for just one play — an eight @-@ yard pass — before the end of the quarter. With one quarter remaining in the game, NC State still held a 21 – 16 lead.

On the first play of the quarter, NC State quarterback Erik Kramer ran the ball, but fumbled at the end of the run. The ball was recovered by Virginia Tech, and the Hokie offense took the field. The first Virginia Tech play of the quarter was a first @-@ down throw to David Everett that drove the Hokies into Wolfpack territory. Tech followed the pass by driving down the field with alternating run and pass plays. Tech penetrated the NC State 20 @-@ yard line with 12 minutes remaining in the quarter, and continued to drive. Once the Hokies crossed the State 10 @-@ yard line, the State defense stiffened and the Hokies were able to gain a first down only with difficulty. With a first down at the State seven @-@ yard line, it took Tech just two plays to earn a touchdown. The Hokies again attempted a two @-@ point conversion, but were again stopped short. Despite that setback, the touchdown gave Tech six points and a 22 – 21 lead, their first since the 8 : 55 mark in the second quarter. 
<|endoftext|> Because Tech committed a 15 @-@ yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty following the touchdown, NC State was able to acquire good field position during the kickoff return, starting their drive at their 44 @-@ yard line. On the second play of the drive, Erik Kramer completed an 18 @-@ yard pass to Nasrallah Worthen, driving State into the Tech side of the field. After a short play, Kramer again completed a long pass, this time to Bobby <unk> for 24 yards. Now inside the Tech red zone, Kramer was tackled for a big loss, losing some of the yardage that he had gained with the previous play. NC State was unable to pick up another first down and sent in Mike Cofer to attempt a 33 @-@ yard kick, which was successfully completed. The field goal regained NC State a 24 – 22 lead. 
<|endoftext|> Following the post @-@ score kick, Tech began its offensive drive at its 23 @-@ yard line with just under seven minutes to play in the game. The Hokies picked up a first down on three short rushing plays, then another on a single passing play. This drove the Hokies to their 45 @-@ yard line with just over five minutes to play. Tech was unable to gain another first down and was forced to punt the ball to NC State. The ball was fielded at the 14 @-@ yard line, which was where the NC State offense began its final drive of the game.

NY 38 is a two @-@ lane local road for most of its length. The route is the main access road to parts of Auburn, Dryden, Newark Valley and Port Byron.

Although it is unknown how long the Dubliners possessed the fortress, in 1036 another son of Sitriuc was slain in Wales by an apparent kinsman, an event which could be evidence of a struggle for control of the site. Echmarcach's aforesaid expulsion of Sitriuc from Dublin in the same year could in turn indicate that this exiled monarch sought refuge in Wales. 
<|endoftext|> Despite the uncertainty of its specific location, Castell Avloed appears to have been situated in territory formerly controlled by Iago, and there is reason to suspect that — after Iago's fall and Cynan's flight — Ímar oversaw military actions against Gruffudd.

<|endoftext|> The nucleus is an organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Inside its fully enclosed nuclear membrane, it contains the majority of the cell's genetic material. This material is organized as DNA molecules, along with a variety of proteins, to form chromosomes.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The nuclear envelope allows the nucleus to control its contents, and separate them from the rest of the cytoplasm where necessary. This is important for controlling processes on either side of the nuclear membrane. In most cases where a <unk> process needs to be restricted, a key participant is removed to the nucleus, where it interacts with transcription factors to <unk> the production of certain enzymes in the pathway. This regulatory mechanism occurs in the case of glycolysis, a cellular pathway for breaking down glucose to produce energy. <unk> is an enzyme responsible for the first the step of glycolysis, forming glucose @-@ 6 @-@ phosphate from glucose.

<|endoftext|> In order to control which genes are being transcribed, the cell separates some transcription factor proteins responsible for regulating gene expression from physical access to the DNA until they are activated by other signaling pathways. This prevents even low levels of inappropriate gene expression. For example, in the case of NF @-@ κB @-@ controlled genes, which are involved in most inflammatory responses, transcription is induced in response to a signal pathway such as that initiated by the signaling molecule <unk> @-@ α, binds to a cell membrane receptor, resulting in the recruitment of <unk> proteins, and eventually activating the transcription factor NF @-@ κB. A nuclear <unk> signal on the NF @-@ κB protein allows it to be transported through the nuclear pore and into the nucleus, where it stimulates the transcription of the target genes. 
<|endoftext|> The compartmentalization allows the cell to prevent translation of <unk> mRNA. <unk> mRNA contains introns that must be removed before being translated to produce functional proteins.

<|endoftext|> In his 2002 doctoral dissertation at Ohio State University, Lawrence D. Bell writes that the governments that preceded Juan Perón had been anti @-@ Semitic but that his government was not. Juan Perón " eagerly and enthusiastically " attempted to recruit the Jewish community into his government and set up a branch of the Peronist party for Jewish members, known as the <unk> <unk> Argentina ( <unk> ). Perón's government was the first to court the Argentine Jewish community and the first to appoint Jewish citizens to public office. Kevin <unk> writes that the Peronist regime, more than any other in Latin America, has been accused of being fascist. But he says that the Peronist regime was not fascist, and what passed for fascism under Perón never took hold in Latin America. Additionally, because the Peronist regime allowed rival political parties to exist, it cannot be described as totalitarian.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> By the late 20th century, Eva Perón had become the subject of numerous articles, books, stage plays, and musicals, ranging from the biography The Woman with the Whip to a 1981 TV movie called Evita Perón with Faye <unk> in the title role. The most successful rendering of Eva Perón's life has been the musical production Evita. The musical began as a concept album co @-@ produced by Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber in 1976, with Julie Covington in the title role. Elaine Paige was later cast in the title role when the concept album was adapted into a musical stage production in London's West End and won the 1978 Olivier Award for Best Performance in a Musical. In 1980, Patti <unk> won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical for her performance as the title character in the Broadway production. Nicholas Fraser claims that to date " the musical stage production has been performed on every continent except Antarctica and has generated over $ 2 billion in revenue. " 
<|endoftext|> As early as 1978, the musical was considered as the basis for a movie. After a nearly 20 @-@ year production delay, Madonna was cast in the title role for the 1996 film version and won the Golden Globe Award for " Best Actress in a Musical or Comedy. " In response to the American film, and in an alleged attempt to offer a more politically accurate depiction of Evita's life, an Argentine film company released Eva Perón : The True Story. The Argentine production starred actress Esther <unk> in the title role. This movie was the 1996 Argentine submission for the Oscar in the category of " Best Foreign Language Film. " 
<|endoftext|> Nicholas Fraser writes that Evita is the perfect popular culture icon for our times because her career foreshadowed

Frank Spotnitz later remarked that he was <unk> at how little negative fan mail the show received, despite the fact that the " Biogenesis " / " The Sixth Extinction " / " Amor Fati " story arc heavily hinted that aliens were the <unk> of the notion of God and religion. He credited the manner in which the show handled this delicate subject, saying, " Often in the past, we've done stuff where I was sure we would get angry letters. But we rarely do. And the reason is because of the way we handle things. In'Amor Fati'we treated the religious side with respect.

Film scholar <unk> Dissanayake agrees that the film brought " a new stage in the evolving dialectic between violence and social order " to Indian cinema. Film scholar M. <unk> Prasad states that Jai and Veeru represent a marginalised population that is introduced into conventional society. Prasad says that, through the elements of revenge included in the plot and the application of Jai and Veeru's <unk> for the greater good, the narrative reflects reactionary politics, and the audience is compelled to accept feudal order. Banerjea explains that though Jai and Veeru are mercenaries, they are <unk> by their emotional needs. Such dualism makes them vulnerable, in contrast to the pure evil of Gabbar Singh. 
<|endoftext|> Gabbar Singh, the film's antagonist, was well received by the audience, despite his pervasive sadistic cruelty.

He further notes that, unlike earlier <unk> in which the female body occupies the audience's attention as an object of male <unk>, in Sholay, the male body becomes the <unk>. It becomes the <unk> where good and evil compete for supremacy. Dissanayake argues that Sholay can be viewed as a national allegory : it lacks a <unk> logical narrative, it shows social stability being repeatedly challenged, and it shows the <unk> of human life resulting from a lack of emotions. Taken together, these elements comprise the allegorical representation of India. The narrative style of Sholay, with its violence, revenge, and <unk> action, is occasionally compared by scholars to the political unrest in India at the time of its release.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In England, burning was a legal punishment inflicted on women found guilty of high treason, petty treason and heresy. Over a period of several centuries, female convicts were publicly burnt at the stake, sometimes alive, for a range of activities including coining and <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> While men guilty of heresy were also burned at the stake, those who committed high treason were instead hanged, drawn and quartered. The English <unk> William Blackstone supposed that the difference in sentencing, although " full as terrible to the sensation as the other ", could be explained by the desire not to publicly expose a woman's body. Public executions were well @-@ attended affairs, and contemporary reports detail the cries of women on the <unk> as they were burned alive. It later became commonplace for the executioner to strangle the convict, and for the body to be burned post @-@ mortem. 
<|endoftext|> In the latter half of the eighteenth century, changing attitudes to such public displays prompted Sir Benjamin Hammett MP to denounce the practice in Parliament. His bill, by no means the first such attempt to end the public burning of women, led to the Treason Act 1790, which abolished the sentence.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The objective of regulation is to " promote high standards of safety in all aspects of aviation ", and this is the main area of interaction between the CAA and the GA sector. Efforts focus on assuring appropriate standards of airworthiness, pilot qualification, the rules for the movement of aircraft, and equipment to be carried. The CAA was established as the primary regulatory body for all aviation in the UK in 1972. In 1991 it started working within the Joint Aviation Authorities ( <unk> ) framework to implement agreed common standards, known as the Joint Aviation <unk> ( JAR ), throughout the European Union ( EU ). In 2003 this was taken a step further when the European Aviation Safety Agency ( EASA ) was established as the central EU regulator, taking over responsibility for <unk> airworthiness and environmental regulation from the national authorities. The CAA acts as an agency of EASA on these issues, retaining its original regulatory powers in areas not yet transferred to EASA.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In the Roman empire's hierarchical system, a vassal king usage of the King of Kings title did not indicate that he is a peer of the emperor or that the <unk> ties were cut. The title was probably a challenge not to the Roman emperor but to Shapur I ; Odaenathus was declaring that he, not the Persian monarch, was the legitimate King of Kings in the East. A <unk> depicting Hairan I shows him wearing a crown shaped like that of the <unk> monarchs, so it must have been Odaenathus'crown ; this combination of title and imagery indicate that Odaenathus considered himself the rival of the <unk> and the protector of the region against them. 
<|endoftext|> Odaenathus'intents are questioned by some historians such as Drinkwater who attribute the attempted negotiations with Shapur to Odaenathus'quest for power. However, in contrast to the norm of his period when powerful generals proclaimed themselves emperors, Odaenathus chose not to <unk> Gallienus'throne, and minted no coins bearing his own image. The king had total control over his kingdom of Palmyra and effective control over the Roman East where his military authority was absolute. Odaenathus respected Gallienus'privilege to appoint provincial governors, but dealt swiftly with opposition ; the Anonymus post Dionem mention the story of <unk> ( <unk> ), a Roman official, who showed dissatisfaction with Odaenathus'authority over the Persian frontier and was immediately executed by the king. 
<|endoftext|> In general, Odaenathus'actions were connected to his and Palmyra's interests only ; his support of Gallienus and his Roman titles did not hide the Palmyrene base of his power and the local origin of his armies, as with his decision not to wait for the emperor to help in 260.

Here, Finkelstein argues that Elie Wiesel and others exploit the memory of the Holocaust as an " ideological weapon. " The purpose, writes Finkelstein, is to enable the State of Israel, " one of the world's most formidable military powers, with a <unk> human rights record, [ to ] cast itself as a victim state ; " that is, to provide Israel " immunity to criticism. " He <unk> what he calls a " double shakedown " by " a repellent gang of <unk>, <unk> and <unk> " seeking enormous legal damages and financial settlements from Germany and Switzerland, <unk> which then go to the lawyers and institutional actors involved in <unk> them, rather than actual Holocaust survivors. 
<|endoftext|> The book received a hostile reception in some quarters, with critics charging that it was poorly researched and / or allowed others to exploit it for antisemitic purposes. The German historian Hans <unk> disparaged the first edition as " a most trivial book, which appeals to easily aroused anti @-@ Semitic prejudices ". Israeli Holocaust historian Israel <unk> called the book " a <unk> ", stating " this is not research ; it isn 't even political literature...

" The book was also harshly criticized by Brown University Professor Omer Bartov and University of Chicago Professor Peter <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> However, <unk> Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg said the book expressed views Hilberg himself subscribed to in substance, in that he too found the exploitation of the Holocaust, as Finkelstein describes, " <unk> ". Asked on another occasion if Finkelstein's analysis might play into the hands of neo @-@ Nazis for antisemitic purposes, Hilberg replied : " Well, even if they do use it in that fashion, I'm afraid that when it comes to the truth, it has to be said openly, without regard to any consequences that would be undesirable, embarrassing ". 
<|endoftext|> Other critics claim Finkelstein's evidence is highly selective and / or dubious and that his arguments would be based on a <unk> of history and a questionable use of sources. The historian David <unk> wrote that while Finkelstein <unk> Swiss banks of serious <unk> towards Holocaust survivors and depicts them as victims of a Jewish terror based on a sentence from an important report annex, he had ignored the report body which describes <unk> actions by Swiss banks, inappropriate closing of accounts, failure to keep adequate records, and so on.

He also claimed that Dershowitz did not write the book, and may not have even read it. 
<|endoftext|> Finkelstein noted 20 instances, in as many pages, where Dershowitz's book cites the same sources and passages used by Joan Peters in her book, in largely the same sequence, with <unk> in the same places. In two instances, Dershowitz <unk> Peters's errors ( see below ). From this Finkelstein concluded that Dershowitz had not checked the original sources himself, contrary to the latter's claims. Finkelstein suggests that this copying of quotations amounts to copying ideas. Examining a copy of a proof of Dershowitz's book he managed to obtain, he found evidence that Dershowitz had his <unk> assistant, Holly Beth Billington, check in the Harvard library the sources he had read in Peters's book.

Aaron Montgomery Ward twice sued the city of Chicago in the 1890s to force it to remove buildings and structures from Grant Park, and to keep it from building new ones. As a result, the city has what are termed the Montgomery Ward height restrictions on buildings and structures in Grant Park.

He also observed that the idea of updating the controls was actually seen as a flaw in Perfect Dark Zero, which tried to " combine the original Perfect Dark system with aspects of Halo ".

At the same time, there was a discussion about who was to operate the new <unk> @-@ airports on the West Coast. Braathens SAFE stated that they wanted a local airline to do the flying, and chose not to apply. The concession was granted to Widerøe, and Braathens SAFE subsequently bought part of the airline.

Hitler was a protégé of Siegfried's wife <unk>, and was known in Bayreuth as " one of <unk>'s lame ducks.

This and future visits to Bayreuth were complicated by the fact that <unk> Wagner fell in love with Walpole, and attached herself so firmly to him that rumours began to spread.

His large income enabled him to maintain his London flat in Piccadilly, but Brackenburn, on the slopes of <unk> overlooking <unk>, was his main home for the rest of his life. He was quickly made welcome by local residents, and the scenery and atmosphere of the Lake District often found their way into his fiction. The critic James Agate commented that one might think from some of Walpole's stories that their author had created the English Lakes, but that he was probably only consulted about them. At the end of 1924 Walpole met Harold Cheevers, who soon became his friend and companion and remained so for the rest of Walpole's life. In Hart @-@ Davis's words, he came nearer than any other human being to Walpole's long @-@ sought conception of a perfect friend.

Whether Walpole was at Brackenburn or Piccadilly, Cheevers was almost always with him, and often accompanied him on overseas trips. Walpole provided a house in Hampstead for Cheevers and his family. 
<|endoftext|> During the mid @-@ twenties Walpole produced two of his best @-@ known novels in the <unk> vein that he drew on from time to time, exploring the fascination of fear and cruelty. The Old Ladies ( 1924 ) is a study of a timid elderly spinster exploited and eventually frightened to death by a predatory widow. Portrait of a Man with Red Hair ( 1925 ) depicts the <unk> influence of a <unk>, insane father on his family and others. Walpole described it to his fellow author Frank <unk> as " a simple <unk> which it has <unk> me like anything to write, and won 't bore you to read. " In contrast he continued a series of stories for children, begun in 1919 with Jeremy, taking the young hero's story forward with Jeremy and Hamlet ( the latter being the boy's dog ) in 1923, and Jeremy at <unk> in 1927. Sadleir, writing in the 1950s, suggests that " the most real Walpole of all – because the most <unk>, kindly, and understanding friend – is the Walpole of the Jeremy trilogy.

The final parody recorded for the album was " <unk> People ", a play on Mick Jagger's " <unk> People ", which was recorded on August 29, 1986. The song, about elderly people who are missing their teeth, was written after Yankovic heard it would be the theme to the 1986 film <unk> People. Assuming the song would be a hit, Yankovic requested and received permission from Jagger to record a parody version. When Jagger's song failed to crack the Top 40, Yankovic considered not recording his version, but because Jagger had " authorized " the parody, he decided failing to produce it would be an insult to the artist.

<|endoftext|> Despite the album's lackluster reception, many of the songs on the album, such as " Dog Eat Dog ", " Addicted to Spuds ", and " Christmas at Ground Zero ", went on to become fan favorites and live staples. Two of the album's tracks, " Living with a Hernia " and " Addicted to Spuds ", appeared on Yankovic's first greatest hits album ( 1988 ), " Christmas at Ground Zero " appeared on the second volume ( 1994 ). In addition, the 1994 box set Permanent Record : Al in the Box contained five of the album's songs : " Addicted to Spuds ", " Dog Eat Dog ", " Here's Johnny ", " Living with a Hernia ", and " Christmas at Ground Zero ".

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Hindenburg was the last battlecruiser completed for the Imperial German Navy, and as such had a very short career. She was commissioned 10 May 1917, and was fully operational by 20 October 1917, too late to see any major action in World War I. On 17 November Hindenburg and Moltke, along with the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group, were acting as distant support for German minesweepers off the German coast when they were attacked by British battlecruisers. The raid was brief ; by the time Hindenburg and Moltke arrived on the scene, the British ships had broken off the attack and withdrawn. Six days later, Hindenburg replaced Seydlitz as flagship of the I Scouting Group. On 23 April 1918, the ship took part in an abortive fleet advance into the North Sea that attempted to intercept an Allied convoy. Moltke sustained mechanical damage while en route, and as a result, Vice Admiral Hipper decided to cancel the operation. On 11 August, Hipper was promoted to Admiral and given command of the entire High Seas Fleet. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter replaced Hipper as the commander of the I Scouting Group ; he raised his flag on Hindenburg the following day. 
<|endoftext|> Hindenburg was interned at Scapa Flow, along with her sister Derfflinger and the rest of the German battlecruisers. She was scuttled on 21 June 1919, and sank at 17 : 00. Several unsuccessful attempts to raise her were made ; on 23 July 1930 the ship was finally raised. From 1930 to 1932 she was scrapped at Rosyth. Her bell was presented to the German Federal Navy on 28 May 1959.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The O 'Brien class of destroyers was a class of six ships designed by and built for the United States Navy shortly before the United States entered World War I. The O 'Brien class was the third of five classes of destroyers that were known as the " thousand tonners ", because they were the first U.S. destroyers over 1 @,@ 000 long tons ( 1 @,@ <unk> t ) displacement. 
<|endoftext|> The design of what became the O 'Brien class was the result of discussions between the General Board of the United States Navy and the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ordnance. What resulted was a design that was an incremental development of the Aylwin class, which itself was similar to the first of the thousand tonners, the Cassin class ( which displaced about a third more than the preceding <unk> class ). The key difference in the O 'Brien class was the increase in torpedo size, going up to 21 inches ( 533 mm ) from the preceding classes'18 @-@ inch ( 457 mm ) torpedoes. 
<|endoftext|> The ships had a median displacement of 1 @,@ 050 long tons ( 1 @,@ 070 t ), were just over 305 feet ( 93 m ) in length, and had a beam of about 31 feet ( 9 @.@ 4 m ). All of the ships had two direct @-@ drive steam turbines and a combination of other engines for cruising at speeds less than 15 knots ( 28 km / h ). All of the ships were designed for a maximum speed of 29 knots ( 54 km / h ). As built, they were armed with four 4 @-@ inch ( 102 mm ) guns and had four twin 21 @-@ inch torpedo tubes with a load of eight torpedoes, but all were later equipped with depth charges. The ships were built by four private American shipyards — Bath Iron Works, Fore River Shipbuilding Company, New York Shipbuilding Corporation, and William Cramp and Sons — and were laid down between September and November 1913 ; launched between April 1914 and February 1915 ; and commissioned into the U.S. Navy between June 1914 and August 1915. 
<|endoftext|> All six ships operated in the Atlantic or Caribbean until the U.S. entrance into World War I in April 1917, when all six were sent overseas to Queenstown, Ireland, for convoy escort duties. Several of the ships rescued passengers and crew from ships sunk by U @-@ boats, and several had encounters with U @-@ boats themselves ; Nicholson helped sink U @-@ 58 in November 1917, the first U @-@ boat sunk by the U.S. Navy.

<|endoftext|>, and almost constant vocalizations particularly from young birds. One of four species in the genus Manorina, the noisy miner itself is divided into four subspecies. The separation of the Tasmanian M. <unk> leachi is of long standing, and the mainland birds were further split in 1999. 
<|endoftext|> Found in a broad arc from Far North Queensland through New South Wales and Victoria to Tasmania and southeastern South Australia, the noisy miner primarily inhabits dry, open eucalypt forests that lack understory shrubs. These include forests dominated by spotted gum, box and ironbark, as well as in degraded woodland where the understory has been cleared, such as recently burned areas, farming and grazing areas, roadside reserves, and suburban parks and gardens with trees and grass but without dense shrubbery. The density of noisy miner populations has significantly increased in many locations across its range, particularly human @-@ dominated habitats. The popularity of nectar @-@ producing garden plants such as the large @-@ <unk> <unk> was thought to play a role in its proliferation, but studies now show that the noisy miner has benefited primarily from <unk> practices that create open areas dominated by eucalypts. 
<|endoftext|> Noisy miners are gregarious and territorial ; they forage, bathe, roost, breed and defend territory <unk>, forming colonies that can contain several hundred birds. Each bird has an'activity space'and birds with overlapping activity spaces form associations called'coteries ', the most stable units within the colony. The birds also form temporary flocks called'coalitions'for specific activities such as mobbing a predator. Group cohesion is facilitated not only by vocalizations, but also through ritualised displays which have been categorised as flight displays, postural displays, and facial displays. The noisy miner is a notably aggressive bird, and chasing, pecking, fighting, scolding, and mobbing occur throughout the day, targeted at both intruders and colony members. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> in the canopy of trees and on trunks and branches and on the ground, the noisy miner mainly eats nectar, fruit and insects. Most time is spent <unk> the foliage of eucalypts, and it can meet most of its nutritional needs from manna, <unk> and <unk> gathered from the foliage. The noisy miner does not use a stereotyped courtship display, but copulation is a frenzied communal event. It breeds all year long, building a deep cup @-@ shaped nest and laying two to four eggs. Incubation is by the female only, although up to twenty male helpers take care of the nestlings and fledglings. Noisy miners have a range of strategies to increase their breeding success including multiple broods and group mobbing of predators. The noisy miner's population increase has been correlated with the reduction of avian diversity in human @-@ affected landscapes. Its <unk> means that translocation is unlikely to be a solution to its overabundance, and culling has been proposed, although the noisy miner is currently a protected species across Australia. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Taxonomy = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> English ornithologist John Latham described the noisy miner four times in his 1801 work <unk> <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> <unk>, seemingly not knowing it was the same bird in each case : the chattering bee @-@ eater ( Merops <unk> ), black @-@ headed <unk> ( <unk> melanocephala ), hooded bee @-@ eater ( Merops <unk> ), and white @-@ fronted bee @-@ eater ( Merops <unk> ). Early notes recorded its tendency to scare off prey as hunters were about to shoot. It was as the chattering bee @-@ eater that it was painted between 1792 and 1797 by Thomas <unk>, one of a group known collectively as the Port Jackson Painter. John Gould treated the name Merops <unk> as the original description, and renamed it <unk> <unk> in his 1865 work <unk> to the Birds of Australia, giving it the common name of garrulous honeyeater, and noting the alternate name of chattering honeyeater. He noted the colonists of Tasmania called it a miner, and aboriginal people of New South Wales called it <unk>. Que <unk> gang was a local aboriginal name from the Blue Mountains. 
<|endoftext|> In the early 20th century, Australian ornithologists started using the name Manorina melanocephala instead, because it was listed first by Latham in 1801.

This lack of interaction may result in a herd with more wild and fewer domestic characteristics, which is of special interest to researchers. Between 1994 and 1997, students from Massey University studied a population of around 400 Kaimanawa horses to learn their habits and herd dynamics. A 2000 study found that although sometimes there are more than two stallions in Kaimanawa horse herds, only the two stallions highest in the herd hierarchy mate with the herd females. This differs from other feral horse herds, some of which have only one stallion that mates with mares, while others have several stallions that sire foals.

<|endoftext|> Las Vegas police. On August 7, 1931, the company cut wages for all tunnel workers. Although the workers sent away the organizers, not wanting to be associated with the " <unk> ", they formed a committee to represent them with the company. The committee drew up a list of demands that evening and presented them to Crowe the following morning. He was <unk>. The workers hoped that Crowe, the general superintendent of the job, would be sympathetic ; instead he gave a scathing interview to a newspaper, describing the workers as " <unk> ". 
<|endoftext|> On the morning of the 9th, Crowe met with the committee and told them that management refused their demands, was stopping all work, and was laying off the entire work force, except for a few office workers and carpenters. The workers were given until 5 p.m. to <unk> the premises. Concerned that a violent confrontation was imminent, most workers took their <unk> and left for Las Vegas to await developments. Two days later, the remainder were talked into leaving by law enforcement. On August 13, the company began hiring workers again, and two days later, the strike was called off. While the workers received none of their demands, the company guaranteed there would be no further reductions in wages. Living conditions began to improve as the first residents moved into Boulder City in late 1931. 
<|endoftext|> A second labor action took place in July 1935, as construction on the dam wound down.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = River diversion = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Before the dam could be built, the Colorado River needed to be diverted away from the construction site. To accomplish this, four diversion tunnels were driven through the canyon walls, two on the Nevada side and two on the Arizona side. These tunnels were 56 ft ( 17 m ) in diameter. Their combined length was nearly 16 @,@ 000 ft, or more than 3 miles ( 5 km ). The contract required these tunnels to be completed by October 1, 1933, with a $ 3 @,@ 000 @-@ per @-@ day fine to be assessed for any delay. To meet the deadline, Six Companies had to complete work by early 1933, since only in late fall and winter was the water level in the river low enough to safely divert. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> began at the lower portals of the Nevada tunnels in May 1931. Shortly afterward, work began on two similar tunnels in the Arizona canyon wall. In March 1932, work began on lining the tunnels with concrete. First the base, or <unk>, was poured. <unk> cranes, running on rails through the entire length of each tunnel were used to place the concrete. The <unk> were poured next. <unk> sections of steel forms were used for the <unk>. Finally, using <unk> guns, the <unk> were filled in. The concrete lining is 3 feet ( 1 m ) thick, reducing the finished tunnel diameter to 50 ft ( 15 m ). The river was diverted into the two Arizona tunnels on November 13, 1932 ; the Nevada tunnels were kept in reserve for high water. This was done by exploding a temporary cofferdam protecting the Arizona tunnels while at the same time dumping rubble into the river until its natural course was blocked. 
<|endoftext|> Following the completion of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete <unk>. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner <unk> are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were <unk> at approximately one @-@ third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works.

Work on the upper cofferdam began in September 1932, even though the river had not yet been diverted. The cofferdams were designed to protect against the possibility of the river flooding a site at which two thousand men might be at work, and their specifications were covered in the bid documents in nearly as much detail as the dam itself. The upper cofferdam was 96 ft ( 29 m ) high, and 750 feet ( 230 m ) thick at its base, as thicker than the dam itself

The role of Vengeur du Peuple was <unk> by Bertrand <unk>, giving birth to an exalted legend. <unk> in France concerning the battle's outcome was divided ; while many celebrated Saint @-@ André's exaggerated accounts of victory in Le Moniteur, senior naval officers disagreed. Among the dissenters was the highly experienced but recently dismissed Admiral Kerguelen. Kerguelen was disgusted by Villaret's failure to renew the battle after he had reformed his squadron, and felt that the French fleet could have been successful tactically as well as strategically if only Villaret had made greater efforts to engage the remains of Howe's fleet. The French Navy had suffered its worst losses in a single day since the Battle of La <unk> in 1692. 
<|endoftext|> Ultimately the revolutionary excesses of the period would prove disastrous for the French Navy. <unk> leadership, conflicting and arbitrary orders and the <unk> of the experienced <unk> in the ranks promoted a negative attitude in the French officer corps. The French <unk> did not contest British dominance in Northern European waters again, and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure at the hands of more confident British squadrons and the <unk> Atlantic weather.

This storm, named Bravo, gradually intensified, becoming fully tropical, at which time it was renamed Fran, a few days later. Upon being renamed, Fran had intensified into a hurricane and maintained this intensity for several days before dissipating east of the Azores on October 12. A few days after Fran dissipated, the final named storm of the year formed in the central Caribbean Sea. A slow moving system, Gilda gradually intensified just below hurricane @-@ intensity before striking Cuba and moving over the Bahamas. A few days after passing through the islands, Gilda became the first storm on record to transition from a tropical cyclone into a subtropical cyclone. A large storm, Gilda eventually became extratropical near Atlantic Canada and dissipated later that month. Around the time Gilda was dissipating, a weak depression briefly existed near the Azores. The final storm of the year was a strong depression in the southern Caribbean Sea.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = = = <unk> openings = = = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In a " reversed opening ", White plays an opening typically played by Black, but with colors reversed and thus an extra tempo. Evans writes of such openings, " If a defense is considered good for Black, it must be even better for White with a move in hand. " Former World Champion Mikhail <unk> reportedly expressed the same view. Watson questions this idea, citing Suba's thesis that Black, by moving second, has more complete information than White. He writes, " everyone has such difficulties playing as White against a Sicilian Defence ( 1.e4 c5 ), but... leading masters have no qualms about answering 1.c4 with 1... e5. " To explain this paradox, Watson discusses several different reversed Sicilian lines, showing how Black can exploit the disadvantages of various " extra " moves for White. He concludes, " The point is, Black's set @-@ up in the Sicilian is fine as a reactive system, but not worth much when trying to claim the initiative as White. This is true because Black is able to react to the specific plan White chooses ; in Suba's terms, his information is indeed a move greater! Furthermore, he is able to take advantage of dead equal positions which White ( hoping to retain the advantage of the first move ) would normally avoid. " 
<|endoftext|> Watson also observes, " Similarly, the Dutch Defence looks particularly sterile when White achieves the reversed positions a tempo up ( it turns out that he has nothing useful to do! ) ; and indeed, many standard Black openings are not very inspiring when one gets them as White, tempo in hand. " GM Alex <unk> likewise notes that GM Vladimir <unk>, a successful exponent of the Leningrad Dutch ( 1.d4 <unk> <unk> g6 ) at the highest levels, " once made a deep impression on me by <unk> <unk> someone's suggestion that he should try <unk> as White.

<|endoftext|> <unk> also agrees with Alekhine's criticism of <unk> e5 2.Nf3, a reversed Alekhine's Defense, in <unk> – Alekhine, Baden @-@ Baden 1925, writing that Alekhine " understood the difference in opening philosophies for White and Black, and realized they just can 't be the same!

" Howard <unk>, generally considered to have been the strongest player in the world from 1843 to 1851, made a similar point over 160 years ago, writing that Owen's Defense ( 1.e4 b6 ) is playable for Black, but that <unk> is inferior to " the more customary [ first ] moves, from its being essentially defensive ".

Djedkare succeeded Menkauhor Kaiu and was in turn succeeded by Unas. His relations to both of these pharaohs remain uncertain, although it is often conjectured that Unas was Djedkare's son owing to the smooth transition between the two. 
<|endoftext|> Djedkare likely enjoyed a long reign of over 40 years, which heralded a new period in the history of the Old Kingdom. Breaking with a tradition followed by his predecessors since the time of Userkaf, Djedkare did not build a temple to the sun god Ra, possibly reflecting the rise of Osiris in the Egyptian pantheon. More significantly, Djedkare effected comprehensive reforms of the Egyptian state administration, the first undertaken since the inception of the system of ranking titles. He also reorganised the funerary cults of his forebears buried in the necropolis of Abusir and reformed the corresponding priesthood. Djedkare commissioned expeditions to Sinai to procure copper and turquoise, to Nubia for its gold and <unk> and to the fabled Land of Punt for its incense. One such expedition had the earliest recorded instance of <unk> divination undertaken to ensure an expedition's success. The word " <unk> ", meaning gold, to designate Nubia is first recorded during Djedkare's reign.

<|endoftext|> Djedkare was buried in a pyramid in Saqqara named Nefer Djedkare ( " Djedkare is perfect " ), which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity.

On 23 June 1823 Charles <unk> showed some to Georges Cuvier, during a <unk> in Paris, but the famous French naturalist at once dismissed them as those of a rhinoceros. Though the very next day Cuvier <unk>, <unk> reported only the dismissal to Mantell, who became rather <unk> about the issue. In 1824 Buckland described Megalosaurus and was on that occasion invited to visit Mantell's collection. Seeing the bones on 6 March he agreed that these were of some giant <unk> — though still denying it was a herbivore. <unk> nevertheless, Mantell again sent some teeth to Cuvier, who answered on 22 June 1824 that he had determined that they were <unk> and quite possibly belonged to a giant herbivore. In a new edition that year of his <unk> sur les <unk> <unk> Cuvier admitted his earlier mistake, leading to an immediate acceptance of Mantell, and his new <unk>, in scientific circles. Mantell tried to <unk> his theory further by finding a modern @-@ day parallel among extant reptiles. In September 1824 he visited the Royal College of Surgeons but at first failed to find comparable teeth. However, assistant @-@ curator Samuel <unk> recognised that they resembled those of an iguana he had recently prepared, albeit twenty times longer. 
<|endoftext|> In recognition of the resemblance of the teeth to those of the iguana, Mantell decided to name his new animal Iguanodon or " iguana @-@ tooth ", from iguana and the Greek word <unk> ( <unk>, <unk> or " tooth " ). Based on isometric scaling, he estimated that the creature might have been up to 18 metres ( 59 feet ) long, more than the 12 metres ( 39 feet ) length of Megalosaurus. His initial idea for a name was Iguana @-@ <unk> ( " Iguana lizard " ), but his friend William Daniel <unk> suggested that that name was more applicable to the iguana itself, so a better name would be <unk> ( " Iguana @-@ like " ) or Iguanodon. He neglected to add a specific name to form a proper binomial, but one was supplied in 1829 by Friedrich Holl : I. <unk>, which was later amended to I. anglicus. 
<|endoftext|> Mantell sent a letter detailing his discovery to the local Portsmouth Philosophical Society in December 1824, several weeks after settling on a name for the fossil creature. The letter was read to members of the Society at a meeting on 17 December, and a report was published in the Hampshire Telegraph the following Monday, 20 December, which announced the name, mis @-@ spelt as " <unk> ". Mantell formally published his findings on 10 February 1825, when he presented a paper on the remains to the Royal Society of London. 
<|endoftext|> A more complete specimen of similar animal was discovered in a quarry in Maidstone, Kent, in 1834 ( lower Lower <unk> Formation ), which Mantell soon acquired. He was led to identify it as an Iguanodon based on its distinctive teeth. The Maidstone slab was utilized in the first skeletal reconstructions and artistic renderings of Iguanodon, but due to its incompleteness, Mantell made some mistakes, the most famous of which was the placement of what he thought was a horn on the nose. The discovery of much better specimens in later years revealed that the horn was actually a modified thumb. Still <unk> in rock, the Maidstone skeleton is currently displayed at the Natural History Museum in London. The borough of Maidstone commemorated this find by adding an Iguanodon as a supporter to their coat of arms in 1949. This specimen has become linked with the name I. mantelli, a species named in 1832 by Christian Erich Hermann von Meyer in place of I. anglicus, but it actually comes from a different formation than the original I. mantelli / I. anglicus material. The Maidstone specimen, also known as Gideon Mantell's " <unk> @-@ piece ", and formally labelled <unk> <unk> was subsequently excluded from Iguanodon. It is classified as cf. Mantellisaurus by McDonald ( 2012 ) ; as cf. Mantellisaurus atherfieldensis by Norman ( 2012 ) ; and made the holotype of a separate species Mantellodon <unk> by Paul ( 2012 )

In September 2001, Torres represented the under @-@ 17 team at the 2001 FIFA U @-@ 17 World Championship, but the team failed to progress through the group stage. In July 2002, he won the 2002 UEFA European Under @-@ 19 Championship with the under @-@ 19 team and was again the only goalscorer in the Final. Also, he finished as top scorer and was named player of the tournament. 
<|endoftext|> Torres made his debut for the senior team on 6 September 2003 in a friendly against Portugal. His first goal for Spain came against Italy on 28 April 2004. He was selected for the Spanish squad for UEFA Euro 2004. After appearing as a late substitute in Spain's first two group games, he started for the deciding game against Portugal. Spain were losing 1 – 0 and, towards the end of the game, he hit the post. 
<|endoftext|> He scored seven goals in 11 appearances in qualifying for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, making him Spain's top scorer for qualification, including a vital two goals against Belgium and his first international hat @-@ trick against San Marino. At his first ever appearance in a FIFA World Cup finals at the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, Torres scored the final goal in a 4 – 0 victory over Ukraine with a volley. In the second group match, Torres scored twice against Tunisia, first in the 76th minute to take Spain 2 – 1 into the lead, and then again from a penalty kick in the 90th. With three goals, he finished the tournament as Spain's top scorer along with fellow striker David Villa. 
<|endoftext|> He was called up for Spain's UEFA Euro 2008 squad, where he set up Villa to score Spain's first goal of the tournament in the first game in the group stage against Russia. Torres came under criticism for apparently refusing to shake the hand of Spanish manager, Luis <unk>, after being substituted. He subsequently denied being angry with the coaching, saying that he was actually " <unk> with himself ". He scored his first goal of the tournament in Spain's next game, a 2 – 1 win over Sweden. Torres scored the winner and was named the man of the match in the final against Germany in a 1 – 0 victory. He said " It's just a dream come true. This is my first title and I hope it's the first of many. Victory in a Euro, it is almost as big as a World Cup. We are used to watching finals on television, but today we were here and we won. My job is to score goals. I want to win more titles and be the most important player in Europe and the world. " He was later named as a striker along with his striking partner Villa in the Team of the Tournament. 
<|endoftext|> Torres made his 60th appearance for Spain in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification victory over Turkey on 28 March 2009, becoming the youngest player to reach this milestone. 
<|endoftext|> He was named in Spain's team for the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup in June. He scored his second hat @-@ trick for Spain after 17 minutes into a Confederations Cup game against New Zealand on 14 June, thus recording the fastest hat @-@ trick by a player for Spain. He played for Spain as they were defeated 2 – 0 by the United States in the semi @-@ final, as well as the third @-@ place play @-@ off, which Spain won 3 – 2 against South Africa after extra time. 
<|endoftext|> Having undergone knee surgery on 18 April 2010, and missed the end of the Premier League season, Torres'rehabilitation and fitness was closely monitored by Spain manager Vicente del Bosque. Although still out injured, Torres was selected for Spain's 2010 FIFA World Cup squad in May. On 8 June, Torres made his first appearance on the field in exactly two months, coming on as a substitute on 66 minutes against Poland in a pre @-@ World Cup friendly. 
<|endoftext|> He came on as a substitute on 61 minutes in Spain's opening World Cup game on 16 June, a 1 – 0 defeat to Switzerland. He started the next two games against Honduras and Chile and although his performances in the group stage were described as below @-@ par, he received backing from manager Vicente del Bosque. Torres came on as a substitute on 105 minutes in the final as Spain won the FIFA World Cup for the first time following a 1 – 0 victory over the Netherlands on 11 July 2010.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The 2000 – 01 season was Fowler's most successful season. He appeared in three finals, scoring 17 goals and lifting three trophies in a unique cup treble. In the absence of Jamie Redknapp, who was sidelined by injury, Fowler was named as Liverpool captain when he started. However he found himself the third @-@ choice Liverpool striker, with Houllier favouring a forward partnership of Michael Owen and Emile Heskey. 
<|endoftext|> He took part in a fourth round League Cup <unk> of Stoke City, scoring a hat @-@ trick in an 8 – 0 victory, which was second only to the club's biggest ever win in 1986 – a 10 – 0 defeat of Fulham. In the League Cup final against Birmingham City, the club's first cup final since 1996, he captained the side and scored in the 30th minute. Liverpool went on to win the trophy on penalties, with Fowler scoring Liverpool's fifth in the shootout. Fowler picked up the Alan <unk> Man of the Match award and lifted the trophy. 
<|endoftext|> Fowler's season picked up from there as he scored several important goals including one against runaway champions Manchester United and a free kick in the FA Cup semi @-@ final against Wycombe Wanderers. Fowler featured as a substitute in the 2001 FA Cup Final coming on as a 77th @-@ minute replacement for <unk> <unk>. Liverpool, who were 1 – 0 down at that point, eventually won the game 2 – 1 with two goals from Owen. Fowler raised the trophy along with Sami <unk> and Jamie Redknapp.

He made an appearance in Liverpool's 3 – 2 European Super Cup victory over Bayern Munich, but starts were intermittent. In October 2001, he scored his first league hat @-@ trick for three years, helping Liverpool beat Leicester City 4 – 1, but was dropped for the following league match.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Proteins are the chief actors within the cell, said to be carrying out the duties specified by the information encoded in genes. With the exception of certain types of RNA, most other biological molecules are relatively inert elements upon which proteins act. Proteins make up half the dry weight of an <unk> coli cell, whereas other macromolecules such as DNA and RNA make up only 3 % and 20 %, respectively. The set of proteins expressed in a particular cell or cell type is known as its <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> The chief characteristic of proteins that also allows their diverse set of functions is their ability to bind other molecules specifically and tightly. The region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule is known as the binding site and is often a depression or " pocket " on the molecular surface. This binding ability is mediated by the tertiary structure of the protein, which defines the binding site pocket, and by the chemical properties of the surrounding amino acids'side chains. Protein binding can be extraordinarily tight and specific ; for example, the ribonuclease inhibitor protein binds to human <unk> with a sub @-@ <unk> <unk> constant ( < 10 − 15 M ) but does not bind at all to its amphibian <unk> <unk> ( > 1 M ). <unk> minor chemical changes such as the addition of a single methyl group to a binding partner can sometimes <unk> to nearly eliminate binding ; for example, the <unk> tRNA <unk> specific to the amino acid <unk> <unk> against the very similar side chain of the amino acid <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Proteins can bind to other proteins as well as to small @-@ molecule substrates. When proteins bind specifically to other copies of the same molecule, they can <unk> to form fibrils ; this process occurs often in structural proteins that consist of globular monomers that self @-@ associate to form rigid fibers. Protein – protein interactions also regulate enzymatic activity, control progression through the cell cycle, and allow the assembly of large protein complexes that carry out many closely related reactions with a common biological function. Proteins can also bind to, or even be integrated into, cell membranes. The ability of binding partners to induce conformational changes in proteins allows the construction of enormously complex signaling networks. <unk>, as interactions between proteins are <unk>, and depend heavily on the availability of different groups of partner proteins to form <unk> that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function, study of the interactions between specific proteins is a key to understand important aspects of cellular function, and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The Guitar Hero series ( sometimes referred to as the Hero series ) is a series of music rhythm games first published in 2005 by RedOctane and Harmonix, and distributed by Activision, in which players use a guitar @-@ shaped game controller to simulate playing lead, bass guitar, and rhythm guitar across numerous rock music songs. Players match notes that scroll on @-@ screen to colored fret buttons on the controller, strumming the controller in time to the music in order to score points, and keep the virtual audience excited. The games attempt to mimic many features of playing a real guitar, including the use of fast @-@ fingering hammer @-@ <unk> and pull @-@ offs and the use of the whammy bar to alter the pitch of notes. Most games support single player modes, typically a Career mode to play through all the songs in the game, and both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes. With the introduction of Guitar Hero World Tour in 2008, the game includes support for a four @-@ player band including vocals and drums. The series initially used mostly cover versions of songs created by <unk> Sound, but most recent titles feature soundtracks that are fully master recordings, and in some cases, special re @-@ recordings, of the songs. Later titles in the series feature support for downloadable content in the form of new songs. 
<|endoftext|> In 2005, RedOctane, a company specializing in the manufacture of unique game controllers, was inspired to create Guitar Hero based on RedOctane's experience creating hardware for Konami's Guitar Freaks arcade game. They enlisted Harmonix, who previously developed several music video games, for development assistance. The first game in the series was made on a budget of $ 1 million. The series became extremely successful, leading to the acquisition of RedOctane by Activision in 2007. Harmonix was acquired by MTV Games and went on to create the Rock Band series of music games in the same vein as Guitar Hero. Activision brought Neversoft ( primarily known for their Tony Hawk series of <unk> games ) on board for future development duties. Additional companies, such as Budcat Creations and Vicarious Visions have assisted in the adaptation of the games for other systems. 
<|endoftext|> The series currently has eight major releases ( six Guitar Hero games, two DJ Hero games and Band Hero ) and five expansions on gaming consoles. There are spin @-@ offs for Windows and Macintosh systems, mobile phones, the Nintendo DS ( the Guitar Hero : On Tour series ), and an arcade game. The Guitar Hero franchise was a primary brand during the emergence of the popularity of rhythm games as a cultural phenomenon in North America. Such games have been utilized as a learning and development tool for medical purposes. The first game in the series was considered by several journalists to be one of the most influential video games of the first decade of the 21st century. The series has sold more than 25 million units worldwide, earning US $ 2 billion at retail, claimed by Activision to be the 3rd largest game franchise after the Mario and <unk> NFL franchises ; the third main title of the series, Guitar Hero III : Legends of Rock is also claimed by Activision to be the first single video game title to exceed $ 1 billion in sales. 
<|endoftext|> Despite early success, the series, along with the overall rhythm game genre, suffered from poor sales starting in 2009. Activision had stated in early 2011 that the series was on hiatus for 2011, while a seventh main title in the series was under development ; this title was later cancelled due to the poor quality of the emerging product.

<|endoftext|> least 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) away on a still night ; wind can carry the sound at least 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ). Males boom for an average of eight hours a night ; each male may produce thousands of booms in this time. This may continue every night for three or four months during which time the male may lose half his body weight. Each male moves around the bowls in his court so that the booms are sent out in different directions. These booms are also notorious for attracting predators, because of the long range at which they can be heard. 
<|endoftext|> Females are attracted by the booms of the competing males ; they too may need to walk several kilometres from their territories to the arena. Once a female enters the court of one of the males, the male performs a display in which he rocks from side to side and makes clicking noises with his beak. He turns his back to the female, spreads his wings in display and walks backwards towards her. He will then attempt copulation for 2 to 14 minutes. Once the birds have mated, the female returns to her home territory to lay eggs and raise the chicks. The male continues booming in the hope of attracting another female. 
<|endoftext|> The female kakapo lays 1 or 2 eggs ( rarely 3 ) per breeding cycle, with long intervals between laying of first and second eggs. She nests on the ground under the cover of plants or in cavities such as hollow tree trunks. The female <unk> the eggs faithfully, but is forced to leave them every night in search of food. Predators are known to eat the eggs and the embryos inside can also die of cold in the mother's absence. Kakapo eggs usually hatch within 30 days, bearing fluffy grey chicks that are quite helpless. After the eggs hatch, the female feeds the chicks for three months, and the chicks remain with the female for some months after fledging. The young chicks are just as vulnerable to predators as the eggs, and young have been killed by many of the same predators that attack adults. Chicks leave the nest at approximately 10 to 12 weeks of age. As they gain greater independence, their mothers may feed the chicks sporadically for up to 6 months. 
<|endoftext|> Because the kakapo is long @-@ lived, with an average life expectancy of 95 years and the maximum at about 120 years, it tends to have an adolescence before it starts breeding. Males do not start to boom until about 5 years of age. It was thought that females reached sexual maturity at 9 years of age, but this idea was <unk> in the 2008 breeding season when two 6 @-@ year @-@ old females named <unk> and Rakiura laid eggs. Generally females do not seek out males until they are between 9 and 11 years old. The kakapo does not breed every year and has one of the lowest rates of reproduction among birds. Breeding occurs only in years when trees mast ( fruit heavily ), providing a plentiful food supply. <unk> mast occurs only every three to five years, so in rimu @-@ dominant forests such as those on Codfish Island, kakapo breeding occurs as infrequently. 
<|endoftext|> Another aspect of the kakapo's breeding system is that a female can alter the sex ratio of her offspring depending on her condition. A female who eats protein @-@ rich foods produces more male offspring ( males have 30 % – 40 % more body weight than females ). Females produce offspring biased towards the <unk> sex when competition for resources ( such as food ) is high and towards the non @-@ <unk> sex when food is plentiful. A female kakapo will likely be able to produce eggs even when there are few resources, while a male kakapo will be more capable of perpetuating the species when there are plenty, by mating with several females. This supports the <unk> – Willard hypothesis. The relationship between clutch sex ratio and maternal diet has conservation implications, because a captive population maintained on a high quality diet will produce fewer females and therefore fewer individuals valuable to the recovery of the species. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Conservation = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> <unk> records indicate that in pre @-@ Polynesian times, the kakapo was New Zealand's third most common bird and it was widespread on all three main islands.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> St Caffo's is built of rubble masonry dressed with limestone, in an early English style ( a style of architecture used between about 1180 and 1275, typically using narrow pointed windows and arches ). The roof is made of slate. The tower, at the west end, has buttresses at the corners and is topped with a <unk> spire, which is a prominent local landmark. Entrance is through an arched doorway in the north side of the tower. The chancel, at the east end of the church, is smaller than the nave in both height and width ; there is a transept on the north side of the chancel. The nave has lancet windows, and there is a further lancet window on the south side of the chancel. The church's east window is set in a pointed arch and has three lights ( sections of window separated by <unk> ). 
<|endoftext|> Inside the church, the sanctuary at the east end is raised above the chancel by one step ; the floor of the sanctuary and the <unk> behind the altar are made from <unk> tiles. <unk> include a circular decorated 12th @-@ century font and a 17th @-@ century pulpit with carved decorative panels. A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire recorded that the church owned a silver cup and a <unk> dated 1736. The transept has a number of memorials dating from the 17th century ( including one to Edward Wynn ), and a stone from the early 7th century inscribed with.. VI / <unk> / <unk> / <unk> / <unk> / <unk> / <unk> / <unk> / <unk> / <unk>. The stone, which is set in the wall, originally came from <unk>, Anglesey. The church porch houses part of a cross head in the shape of a wheel, dating from the 9th or 10th century ; part of the rest of the cross is in the churchyard, but it has suffered significant weather damage with most of the patterns worn away. 
<|endoftext|> The oldest graves are to the north of the church, which is unusual : ordinarily the southern part of the churchyard would be used first for burials, with the northern part remaining <unk> unless and until extra space for graves was required. The path between the road and the church has sunken, which may partly be explained by the medieval custom of burying the dead on top of each other. One author has suggested that the mound alongside the path might indicate that the church is located in the site of a Bronze Age settlement. 
<|endoftext|> The churchyard has seven gravestones that were discovered in the walls of the previous church. Six of them date from between the 9th and 11th centuries, and the seventh is from the 12th or 13th century. The doorway from the old church, dating from the 15th century, has been reused as an entrance to the churchyard. A carved stone human head, from the 12th century, has been inserted into the north wall of the churchyard.

A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey says that the " impressive " tower and steeple " form " a landmark visible for many miles.

According to a BBC Sport profile, many <unk> considered that the announcement, and Mosley's public disagreements with Ecclestone, were " just part of a well crafted plan to strengthen their control over the sport " ; Ron Dennis, the McLaren team principal, suggested that it arose because Mosley's proposals for Formula One met opposition.

Hartmann points that there have been cases where a Greek word was translated directly to Palmyrene and a Palmyrene equivalent was also used to mean the same thing.

Palmyra itself, although officially still part of the Roman empire, became a de facto allied state to Rome instead of a provincial city.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Perhaps driven by the will to take revenge for the destruction of Palmyrene trade centers and discourage Shapur from initiating future attacks, Odaenathus launched an invasion against the Persians. In the spring of 262, the king marched north into the occupied Roman province of Mesopotamia, driving out the Persian garrisons and freeing Edessa and Carrhae. The first <unk> was aimed at Nisibis, which Odaenathus regained but sacked since the inhabitants were sympathetic toward the Persian occupation. The Palmyrene monarch destroyed the Jewish city of Nehardea, 45 km west of the Persian capital Ctesiphon, as he deemed the Jews of Mesopotamia loyal to Shapur. By late 262 or early 263, Odaenathus stood at the walls of the Persian capital. 
<|endoftext|> The exact route taken by Odaenathus from Palmyra to Ctesiphon remains uncertain ; it is probably similar to the route emperor Julian took in <unk> during his campaign against Persia. Using this route, Odaenathus would have crossed the Euphrates at <unk> then moved east to Edessa followed by Carrhae then Nisibis ; here, he would have descended south along the <unk> River to the Euphrates valley and marched alongside the river's left bank to Nehardea. After taking the city, he penetrated the Sassanian province of <unk> and marched along the royal canal <unk> towards the <unk> where the Persian capital stood. 
<|endoftext|> Once at Ctesiphon, Odaenathus immediately began the siege of the well @-@ fortified winter residence of the Persian kings ; severe damage was inflicted upon the surrounding areas due to the battles with Persian troops. The city held its ground and the logistical problems of fighting in enemy's land probably prompted the Palmyrenes to lift the siege. Odaenathus headed north along the Euphrates carrying with him numerous prisoners and booty. The invasion resulted in the full restoration of the Roman lands ( <unk> and Mesopotamia provinces ) occupied by Shapur since the beginning of his invasions in 252. However, Dura @-@ <unk> and other Palmyrene posts south of <unk>, such as <unk>, were not rebuilt.

Since the 19th century, by convention, the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet — who are then <unk> to Parliament for the decision — has been required in order for the prerogative to be exercised. The monarch remains <unk> empowered to exercise the royal prerogative against the advice of the prime minister or the cabinet, but in practice would only do so in <unk> or where existing precedent does not adequately apply to the circumstances in question. 
<|endoftext|> Today the royal prerogative is available in the conduct of the government of the United Kingdom, including foreign affairs, defence, and national security. The monarchy has a significant constitutional presence in these and other matters, but limited power, because the exercise of the prerogative is in the hands of the prime minister and other ministers or other government officials. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Definition = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The royal prerogative has been called " a notoriously difficult concept to define adequately ", but whether a particular type of prerogative power exists is a matter of common law to be decided by the courts as the final <unk>. A prominent constitutional theorist, A. V. Dicey, proposed in the nineteenth century that : 
<|endoftext|> The prerogative appears to be historically and as a matter of fact nothing else than the residue of discretionary or arbitrary authority which at any given time is legally left in the hands of the crown. The prerogative is the name of the remaining portion of the Crown's original authority... Every act which the executive government can <unk> do without the authority of an Act of Parliament is done in virtue of the prerogative. 
<|endoftext|> While many commentators follow the <unk> view, there are constitutional lawyers who prefer the definition given by William Blackstone in the <unk> : 
<|endoftext|> By the word prerogative we usually understand that special pre @-@ <unk> which the King hath, over and above all other persons, and out of the ordinary course of common law, in right of his regal dignity... it can only be applied to those rights and capacities which the King enjoys alone, in contradiction to others, and not to those which he enjoys in common with any of his subjects. 
<|endoftext|> Dicey's opinion that any action of governance by the monarch beyond statute is under the prerogative <unk> from Blackstone's that the prerogative simply covers those actions that no other person or body in the United Kingdom can undertake, such as the dissolution of Parliament. Case law exists to support both views. Blackstone ’ s notion of the prerogative being the powers of an exclusive nature was favoured by Lord <unk> in the De <unk> ’ s Royal Hotel case of 1920, but some difficulty with it was expressed by Lord Reid in the <unk> Oil case of 1965. A clear distinction has not been necessary in the relevant cases, and the courts may never need to settle the question as few cases deal directly with the prerogative itself. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = History = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The royal prerogative originated as the personal power of the monarch. From the 13th century in England, as in France, the monarch was all @-@ powerful, but this absolute power was checked by " the <unk> of feudal turbulence in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries ". An early attempt to define the royal prerogative was stated by Richard II's judges in <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> During the 16th century, this " turbulence " began to <unk>, and the monarch became truly independent. Under Henry VIII and his successors, the king was the head of the Protestant English church, and therefore not <unk> to the clergy. The rise of Parliament in this period, however, was problematic. While the monarch was " the predominant partner in the English constitution ", the courts stopped short of declaring him all @-@ powerful, recognizing the role that Parliament played. In <unk>'s Case, Henry recognised this, noting that he was far more powerful with the consent of Parliament than without. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the matter of taxation : Sir Thomas Smith and other writers of the period pointed out the monarch could not impose taxation without Parliament's consent. 
<|endoftext|> At the same time, Henry and his descendants normally followed the will of the courts, despite the fact they were theoretically not bound by judges. William Holdsworth <unk> that by regularly asking the legal officers of the crown and judiciary for legal advice and consent, Henry recognised the need for a stable government to follow the law. He also contends that the view that the law is supreme over all " was the view of all the leading lawyers and <unk> and <unk> of the Tudor period ". It was accepted that while the King had " <unk> discretion ", he was limited in areas where the courts had imposed conditions on the use of

<|endoftext|> Shortly before Bloody Sunday was broadcast, Nesbitt described it as " difficult but extraordinary " and " emotionally draining ". The broadcast on ITV in January 2002 and its promotion did not pass without incident ; he was criticised by <unk> for saying that Protestants in Northern Ireland felt " a collective guilt " over the killings. His parents'home was also vandalised and he received death threats. During the awards season, Nesbitt won the British Independent Film Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a British Independent Film and was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor. The film was also screened at film festivals such as the Stockholm International Film Festival, where Nesbitt was presented with the Best Actor award. 
<|endoftext|> In an analysis of the film in the History & Memory journal, <unk> Blaney wrote that it is Nesbitt's real @-@ life household name status that made his portrayal of Cooper such a success. She reasoned that Nesbitt's celebrity status mirrors that of Cooper's in the 1970s : " A household name across Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic [ sic ], Nesbitt's widespread popular appeal is emphatically not contingent upon his Protestant Ulster identity, and consequently the double @-@ voicing of the character he plays does not alienate viewers of an alternative, or no, sectarian persuasion. " Guardian journalist Susie Steiner suggested that his appearance in Bloody Sunday was an attempt to resolve the expression of his " <unk> " on screen : " Where he has taken part in a sectarian theme, his intelligence as an actor has often been masked by an excessive, cartoon @-@ style comedy. Yet in his more successful, high @-@ profile roles, ( notably in Cold Feet, and as Pig Finn in the gently pastoral film Waking Ned ), Nesbitt's <unk> has been exploited for its romantic charm. It has been <unk> and, in the process, de @-@ <unk>. " A critic identified Bloody Sunday as Nesbitt's " coming of age " film, and Nesbitt called it a turning point in his career.

A 90 @-@ minute pilot of Murphy's Law was commissioned by the BBC, initially as a " comedy action adventure ". Bateman created a complex backstory for Murphy, which was cut at the request of the producers. After the broadcast of the pilot, Guardian critic Gareth McLean wrote, " the likeable James Nesbitt turned in a strong, extremely <unk> central performance, though rarely did he look <unk> by his efforts, and his chemistry with [ <unk> ] Harrison was promising and occasionally electric.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Originally created by <unk> glaciers, Spanish Hill comprises approximately 10 acres ( 40 @,@ 000 m2 ) of earth in a site that is part of the <unk> <unk>. Located at an elevation of 978 feet ( 298 m ) above sea level, it rises approximately 230 feet ( 70 m ) over the nearby floodplain of the <unk> River. The hill is located in South Waverly, Pennsylvania, in Bradford County, just south of the state border with New York, inside of territory once occupied by the <unk> people. It has been acknowledged and studied by historians and archaeologists for over two hundred years. The source of the name is unknown, but individuals traveling through the area between 1795 and 1804 described " Spanish <unk> " as a feature of the hill, and some of the earliest settlers to the region report that local Native Americans referred to the hill either as " <unk> " or " <unk>. " In 1615, Étienne Brûlé was sent to the area by Samuel de Champlain to meet with Native American tribes in the hope of finding assistance to fight the Iroquois, against whom Champlain had allied with the <unk> people. During his voyage, Brûlé recorded a town called Carantouan ( meaning " Big Tree, " according to <unk> William Martin <unk> ), which was subsequently included on a map published by de Champlain in 1632. In the early nineteenth @-@ century, a Native American man who lived in the area near Spanish Hill reportedly refused to ascend it, for fear of a deadly spirit that lived on top. According to the man, the spirit spoke with a <unk> voice and " made holes through Indians'bodies. " Archaeologist Louise Welles Murray suggested that this could be a reference to cannon or musket fire. 
<|endoftext|> In the early twentieth century, archaeological and historical research was conducted regarding a potential connection between Carantouan and the structures described on the hill. After surveying the area in spring and fall, archaeologist <unk> Shoemaker discovered evidence of Native American habitation, including shell <unk>, corn and flint chips, along with various other implements. In 1918, historian and archaeologist George P. <unk>, after a survey of the site, determined that it was impossible for Spanish Hill to have been the site of the town described by Brûlé. He cited the sharp incline, which would have made ascension difficult, as well as the lack of water and archaeological evidence on the hill as evidence against it having been the location of Carantouan. <unk> that Spanish Hill was the site of the village was also countered by James Bennett Griffin, who found nothing of interest in the area following an archaeological survey in 1931. However, historian <unk> <unk> suggests that prior excavations conducted by early twentieth @-@ century archaeologist Warren <unk>, as well as years of heavy farming activity in the area may have contributed to the lack of artifacts found during the Griffin expedition.

<|endoftext|> The governing body, the Welsh Rugby Union ( WRU ), was established in 1881, the same year that Wales played their first international against England. Wales'performances in the Home Nations Championship ( now the Six Nations ) continued to improve, experiencing their first'golden age'between 1900 and 1911. They first played New Zealand, known as the All Blacks, in 1905, when they defeated them 3 – 0 in a famous match at Cardiff Arms Park. Welsh rugby struggled between the two World Wars, but experienced a second'golden age'between 1969 and 1980 when they won eight Five Nations Championships. 
<|endoftext|> Wales played in the inaugural Rugby World Cup in 1987 where they achieved their best ever result of third. Following the sport allowing professionalism in 1995, Wales hosted the 1999 World Cup and, in 2005, won their first @-@ ever Six Nations Grand Slam.

<|endoftext|> The cougar and <unk> are most closely related to the modern cheetah of Africa and western Asia, but the relationship is unresolved. The cheetah lineage is suggested by some studies to have diverged from the Puma lineage in the Americas ( see American cheetah ) and migrated back to Asia and Africa, while other research suggests the cheetah diverged in the Old World itself. The outline of small feline migration to the Americas is thus unclear.

<|endoftext|> In the time after myth, most gods were said to be either in the sky or <unk> present within the world. Temples were their main means of contact with humanity. Each day, it was believed, the gods moved from the divine realm to their temples, their homes in the human world. There they inhabited the cult images, the statues that depicted deities and allowed humans to interact with them in temple rituals. This movement between realms was sometimes described as a journey between the sky and the earth. As temples were the focal points of Egyptian cities, the god in a city's main temple was the patron god for the city and the surrounding region. Deities'spheres of influence on earth centered on the towns and regions they presided over. Many gods had more than one cult center, and their local ties changed over time. They could establish themselves in new cities, or their range of influence could contract. Therefore, a given deity's main cult center in historical times is not necessarily his or her place of origin. The political influence of a city could affect the importance of its patron deity. When kings from Thebes took control of the country at start of the Middle Kingdom ( c. 2055 – 1650 BC ), they elevated Thebes'patron gods — first the war god <unk> and then Amun — to national prominence. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Names and epithets = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In Egyptian belief, names express the fundamental nature of the things to which they refer. In keeping with this belief, the names of deities often relate to their roles or origins. The name of the predatory goddess <unk> means " powerful one ", the name of the mysterious god Amun means " hidden one ", and the name of the goddess <unk>, who was worshipped in the city of <unk>, means " she of <unk> ". But many other names have no certain meaning, even when the gods who bear them are closely tied to a single role. The names of the sky goddess <unk> and the earth god <unk> do not resemble the Egyptian terms for sky and earth. 
<|endoftext|> The Egyptians also devised false etymologies giving more meanings to divine names. A passage in the Coffin Texts renders the name of the funerary god <unk> as <unk> r, meaning " cleaning of the mouth ", to link his name with his role in the Opening of the Mouth ritual, while one in the Pyramid Texts says the name is based on words shouted by Osiris, connecting <unk> with the most important funerary deity. 
<|endoftext|> The gods were believed to have many names. Among them were secret names that conveyed their true natures more profoundly than others. To know the true name of a deity was to have power over it. The importance of names is demonstrated by a myth in which Isis poisons the superior god Ra and refuses to cure him unless he reveals his secret name to her. Upon learning the name, she tells it to her son, Horus, and by learning it they gain greater knowledge and power. 
<|endoftext|> In addition to their names, gods were given epithets, like " <unk> of <unk> ", " ruler of Abydos ", or " lord of the sky ", that describe some aspect of their roles or their worship. Because of the gods'multiple and overlapping roles, deities can have many epithets — with more important gods accumulating more titles — and the same epithet can apply to many deities. Some epithets eventually became separate deities, as with <unk>, an epithet applied to several goddesses meaning " great <unk> ", which came to be treated as an independent goddess. The host of divine names and titles expresses the gods'<unk> nature. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Relationships = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Egyptian deities are connected in a complex and shifting array of relationships. A god's connections and interactions with other deities helped define its character. Thus Isis, as the mother and protector of Horus, was a great <unk> as well as the <unk> of kings. Such relationships were the base material from which myths were formed. 
<|endoftext|> Family relationships are a common type of connection between gods. Deities often form male and female pairs, reflecting the importance of procreation in Egyptian religious thought. Families of three deities, with a father, mother, and child, represent the creation of new life and the succession of the father by the child, a pattern that connects divine families with royal succession. Osiris, Isis, and Horus formed the quintessential family of this type. The pattern they set grew more widespread over time, so that many deities in local cult centers, like Ptah, <unk>, and their child <unk

Bradstreet and John Norton were chosen as agents to deliver the letter to London. Charles renewed the charter, but sent the agents back to Massachusetts with a letter <unk> conditions to his assent. The colony was expected, among other things, to expand religious tolerance to include the Church of England and religious minorities like the Quakers. The agents were harshly criticized by hardline factions of the legislature, but Bradstreet defended the need to accommodate the king's wishes as the <unk> course to take. How to respond to the king's demands divided the colony ; Bradstreet was part of the moderate " <unk> " faction arguing that the colony should obey the king's wishes. This faction lost the debate to the hardline " commonwealth " faction, who were in favor of aggressively maintaining the colony's charter rights, led through the 1660s by governors John <unk> and Richard <unk>. With Charles distracted by war with the Dutch and domestic politics in the late 1660s, the issue lay <unk> until the mid @-@ <unk>.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In early 1679 Governor John Leverett died, and Bradstreet as deputy succeeded him. Leverett had opposed accommodation of the king's demands, and the change to an <unk> leadership was too late. Bradstreet would turn out to be the last governor under its original charter. His deputy, Thomas <unk> was from the commonwealth faction. During his tenure, crown agent Edward Randolph was in the colony, attempting to enforce the Navigation Acts, under which certain types of trade involving the colony were illegal. Randolph's enforcement attempts were vigorously resisted by both the merchant classes and sympathetic magistrates despite Bradstreet's attempts to accommodate Randolph. <unk> frequently refused to <unk> ships accused of violating the acts ; in one instance Bradstreet tried three times to get a jury to change its verdict. Randolph's attempts to enforce the navigation laws eventually convinced the colony's general court that it needed to create its own mechanisms for their enforcement. A bill to establish a naval office was vigorously debated in 1681, with the house of deputies, dominated by the commonwealth party, opposing the idea, and the moderate magistrates supporting it. The bill that finally passed was a victory for the commonwealth party, making enforcement difficult and subject to reprisal lawsuits. Bradstreet refused to actually implement the law, and Randolph published open challenges to it. Bradstreet was in some degree vindicated when he won re @-@ election in 1682, and he then used his judicial authority to further undermine the law's effects. 
<|endoftext|> Randolph's threats to report the colonial legislature's <unk> prompted it to dispatch agents to England to argue the colony's case ; however, their powers were limited. Shortly after their arrival in late 1682, the Lords of Trade issued an ultimatum to the colony : either grant its agents wider powers, including the ability to negotiate modifications to the charter, or risk having the charter <unk>. The general court responded by issuing the agents instructions to take a hard line. Following legal processes begun in 1683, the charter was formally <unk> on October 23, 1684.

<|endoftext|> The idea of revolt against Andros arose as early as January 1689, before news of the December 1688 Glorious Revolution reached Boston. After William and Mary took the throne, Increase Mather and Sir William Phips, Massachusetts agents in London, petitioned them and the Lords of Trade for restoration of the Massachusetts charter. Mather furthermore convinced the Lords of Trade to delay notifying Andros of the revolution.

<|endoftext|> Venus transits are historically of great scientific importance as they were used to gain the first realistic estimates of the size of the Solar System. Observations of the 1639 transit, combined with the principle of parallax, provided an estimate of the distance between the Sun and the Earth that was more accurate than any other up to that time. The 2012 transit provided scientists with a number of other research opportunities, particularly in the refinement of techniques to be used in the search for exoplanets.

Although the inclination between these two orbital planes is only 3 @.@ 4 °, Venus can be as far as 9 @.@ 6 ° from the Sun when viewed from the Earth at inferior conjunction.

At the start of season six, however, the producers and writers felt that Skinner's character was becoming " expendable ". With their transfer away from the X @-@ Files division, Mulder and Scully saw less and less of their former boss. Originally, John Shiban, the writer of the episode, wanted to infect Mulder with nanobots. However, he decided that since the audience knew Mulder would not be killed, this plot would not be very effective.

<|endoftext|> Black should strive to neutralize White's initiative and attain equality. Because White begins with the initiative, a minor mistake by White generally leads only to loss of the initiative, while a similar mistake by Black may have more serious consequences. Thus, Sveshnikov wrote in 1994, " Black players cannot afford to make even the slightest mistake... from a theoretical point of view, the tasks of White and Black in chess are different : White has to strive for a win, Black — for a draw! " 
<|endoftext|> Chess theorists have long debated how enduring White's initiative is and whether, if both sides play perfectly, the game should end in a win for White or a draw. George Walker wrote in 1846 that, " The first move is an advantage,... but if properly answered, the first move is of little worth ". <unk>, the first World Champion, who is widely considered the father of modern chess, wrote in 1889, " It is now conceded by all experts that by proper play on both sides the legitimate issue of a game ought to be a draw. " Lasker and Capablanca, the second and third World Champions, agreed. <unk> Fine, one of the world's leading players from 1936 to 1951, wrote that White's opening advantage is too <unk> to be sufficient for a win without an error by Black. 
<|endoftext|> The view that a game of chess should end in a draw given best play prevails. Even if it cannot be proved, this assumption is considered " safe " by Rowson and " logical " by Adorján. Watson agrees that " the proper result of a perfectly played chess game... is a draw.... Of course, I can 't prove this, but I doubt that you can find a single strong player who would disagree.... I remember Kasparov, after a last @-@ round draw, explaining to the waiting reporters :'Well, chess is a draw.'" World Champion Bobby Fischer thought that was almost definitely so. 
<|endoftext|> Lasker and Capablanca both worried that chess would suffer a " draw death " as top @-@ level players drew more and more of their games. More recently, Fischer agreed, saying that the game has become played out. All three advocated changing the rules of chess to minimize the number of drawn games. Lasker suggested scoring less than half a point for a draw, and more than half a point for <unk> the opponent's king. Capablanca in the 1920s proposed Capablanca chess, a chess variant played on a larger board and with additional pieces. Fischer advocated Fischer Random Chess, another chess variant, in which the initial position of the pieces is determined at random. 
<|endoftext|> Today some of the <unk> opening variations have been analyzed so deeply that they are often used as drawing weapons. For example, at the highest levels, Black often uses the Marshall Attack in the Ruy Lopez, a line where Black sacrifices a pawn for strong attacking chances, to obtain an endgame where Black is still a pawn down but is able to draw with correct play.

The Larger Catechism, intended to assist ministers in teaching the Reformed faith to their congregations. The Shorter Catechism was based on the Larger Catechism but intended for use in teaching the faith to children. Parliament demanded scripture proofs for the catechisms as well. The Scots General Assembly approved both catechisms in 1648. 
<|endoftext|> The Assembly understood its mandate under the <unk> League and Covenant to have been fulfilled on 14 April 1648 when it delivered the scripture citations to Parliament, and the Scottish Commissioners had already left by the end of 1647. The Assembly continued to meet primarily for the purpose of examination of ministers for ordination. Most of the divines were unhappy with the republican Commonwealth that emerged after Colonel Pride's <unk> of the Long Parliament in 1648. As a result, a majority stopped attending rather than agree to the oath of <unk> to the Commonwealth that was imposed in 1649. Newspapers continued to report on the meetings of the Assembly as late as March 1653. The Assembly must have stopped meeting sometime between then and Cromwell's dissolution of the <unk> Parliament on 20 April 1653.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The Assembly was a product of the British Reformed tradition, taking as a major source the Thirty @-@ Nine Articles as well as the theology of James <unk> and his Irish Articles of 1615. The divines also considered themselves to be within the broader European Reformed tradition. They were in frequent correspondence with continental Reformed theologians, and sought their approval. They also drew upon the pre @-@ Reformation British theological tradition, which emphasized biblical knowledge and was influenced by the <unk> theological tradition exemplified by Anselm, Thomas <unk>, and John <unk>. The recorded debates of the Assembly are full of citations of church fathers and medieval scholastic theologians. 
<|endoftext|> The Confession starts with the doctrine of revelation, or how people can know about God. The divines believed knowledge of God was available to people through nature as well as the Bible, but they also believed that the Bible, or Scripture, is the only way in which people attain saving knowledge of God. The doctrine of Scripture was also a particularly important area of debate at the time. Scholars had begun to argue that the Hebrew vowel points, marks added to the text to aid in pronunciation, of the Old Testament were probably not part of the original. This caused significant debate between Reformed <unk> and Roman Catholics. Catholics argued that such a discovery demonstrated the need for an authoritative <unk> to interpret the Bible as opposed to the Protestant doctrine of <unk>, that the essential teachings of the Bible could be interpreted by anyone. English Reformed writers in particular took up the work of defending the Reformed doctrine. The divines had a strong view of the inspiration of the Bible, and believed that God revealed himself in the propositions found in Scripture. While the issue of biblical <unk>, the belief that there are no errors in the Bible, did not arise until the eighteenth century, the divines clearly did not believe the Bible to contain any errors. Many of the divines held a rather mechanical view of biblical inspiration, believing that not only the words and ideas but also the letters and vowel points of the Hebrew text were inspired by God. On the other hand, they acknowledged that the text was written by humans in their own styles. They did not make any distinction between essential and incidental matters with respect to biblical inspiration. 
<|endoftext|> Puritans believed that God is sovereign over all of history and nature and that none of what were called his decrees would be frustrated. There was significant debate in the Assembly over the relationship of God's decree of <unk>, or choice to save some people, to the redemption purchased by Christ's death. Many of the Reformed during this period taught that Christ died with the purpose only to save those who were <unk> chosen to be saved, a doctrine called particular redemption. A vocal minority of the divines of the Assembly argued for a position known as hypothetical <unk>. Edmund <unk> held such a view, and he argued that Christ's death, as well as saving those who had been chosen, offered salvation to all people on condition that they believe. The Assembly's Confession did not teach such a view, and its language is much more amenable to a particular redemption interpretation, but there is a general agreement among scholars that the Confession's language allows an hypothetical <unk> interpretation.

<|endoftext|> Although Hardy states that the <unk> people did not live in the ranges themselves, they did live on the lower slopes. An early settler of the neighbouring suburb of Beaumont, James Milne Young, described the local <unk> : " At every creek and gully you would see their <unk> [ simple Aboriginal homes made out of twigs and grass ] and their fires at night... often as many as 500 to 600 would be camped in various places... some behind the <unk> Gardens on the banks of the river ; some toward the Ranges ; some on the Waterfall Gully. " Their main presence, <unk> by the use of fire against <unk> of land, was on the River Torrens and the creeks that flowed into it, including Waterfall Gully's First Creek. 
<|endoftext|> The land around Waterfall Gully provided the original inhabitants with a number of resources. The bark from the local <unk> trees ( Eucalyptus <unk> ) was used in the construction of winter <unk>, and stones and native timbers were used to form tools.

In making their ascent the party <unk> a ravine — described by Mr Kent as possessing " smooth and grassy sides " — which is believed by Anne Hardy to have been Waterfall Gully. Subsequent to Barker's ascent, the first settlers who were recorded as having climbed Mount Lofty were <unk> Hutchinson and his servant, William Burt. The pair made three attempts to scale the mount before succeeding, and for their first attempt they attempted to traverse Waterfall Gully. The attempt was unsuccessful, but in July 1837, Hutchinson wrote about the gully through which they had travelled. Waterfall Gully he wrote, had proven difficult, as the plants were so thickly grown as to provide a significant barrier to their progress. Near the point of surrender, Hutchinson described how they were " <unk> surprised by seeing a wall of rock about fifty or sixty feet [ fifteen to eighteen metres ] high, which stretched across the ravine, and from the top of it leapt the brook which had so long been [ their ] companion ". The brook was First Creek, and the waterfall they sighted is today known as First Falls. 
<|endoftext|> Nevertheless, Hutchinson was not the first to see First Falls. The first known recorded sighting of the waterfall by a colonial was that of John William Adams, an <unk> of HMS Buffalo in early January 1837, who named it " Adams'Waterfall ".

Old Pine Church and its predecessor structures were probably utilized by members of the Beaver Run congregation because the distance between the northern region of the valley and the church on Beaver Run was too great to traverse easily. Thus, Old Pine Church began as a mission of the Beaver Run congregation. Because of its location in the vicinity of the Hardy County boundary line, the district served by the church spanned both counties.

According to the Beaver Run Church Book, membership at Old Pine Church was 78 in 1879 and numbered 100 in 1881. The Beaver Run congregation modified its district's boundaries in 1879, which may have resulted in a division of the congregation at Old Pine Church into two factions : White Pine Church of the Brethren and Old Pine Church. Both churches continued to worship at Old Pine Church at different times.

At the hamlet of Pocantico Hills, the highway intersects with Lake Road and turns to the northeast, passing through more residential areas as it leaves the estate. NY 448 passes the Pocantico Hills Central School on its way, continuing northeast towards <unk> Way ( NY 117 ). The road continues through a vacant area and heads northward into Mount Pleasant, where NY 448 terminates at an intersection with NY 117. Bedford Road continues east of this point as part of NY 117. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = History = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The entirety of NY 448 was originally designated as part of NY 117 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. In 1932 – 33, John D. Rockefeller offered to <unk> a short section of NY 117 that passed through Kykuit, the Rockefeller family estate, citing safety concerns. The state expressed similar sentiments in 1949, deeming the stretch unsafe for commercial traffic. By the 1960s, the annual average daily traffic count along NY 117 had grown to 5 @,@ 000 vehicles per day, far more than the 1 @,@ 800 that the road had originally been built to serve. This led the New York State Legislature to approve plans for a new alignment for NY 117 in 1965. The new road would be located north of the existing road, relieving traffic congestion on the Albany Post Road ( US 9 ) and NY 117 and providing access to NY <unk>, US 9, the <unk> State Parkway and the proposed Hudson River Expressway in the North Tarrytown area. 
<|endoftext|> Several different routes were considered for the alignment. The path ultimately selected by the state was a four @-@ lane, limited @-@ access highway 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of the current alignment that would cost $ 5 @.@ 5 million ( 1966 USD ). Another proposed route would have cost $ 8 million ( 1966 USD ), containing additional grades and curves while coming closer to the Rockefeller estate. Construction on the new NY 117 was expected to begin before the end of 1966. The reaction from area residents was mixed, with some believing that the only beneficiaries of a realigned NY 117 was the Rockefeller family. <unk> that the Rockefeller family had wanted NY 117 moved had existed as early as the 1930s, and US Representative Richard <unk> believed that Nelson Rockefeller, then the Governor of New York, was using his political power to move NY 117 away from Kykuit at the cost of the state. An aide to the <unk> denied this charge. 
<|endoftext|> The Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee, comprising 11 members whose homes were in the right @-@ of @-@ way of the new alignment, protested that the route would destroy the countryside. They were opposed by the <unk> Hills Residents Committee, as most residents in <unk> Hills supported the new alignment. The former committee filed a lawsuit in the New York State Supreme Court to block the new roadway, and they were joined in their efforts by <unk> groups and the village of North Tarrytown. On June 28, 1966, the case was heard by the court. Engineers with the New York State Department of Highways were accused of showing " unprecedented <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> " in working on a project with the <unk> before any <unk> could stop it. State Attorney General Joseph Romano countered that the state was not conspiring to provide anyone special benefits, saying that NY 117 was dangerous for years and opponents to the project were " thinking up little <unk>, <unk> arguments and <unk> ideas to mislead the court. " 
<|endoftext|> A request by the state to dismiss the suit was denied in August 1966, and the case was eventually heard by the state Court of Appeals, the highest court in the state. In the meantime, the state built the easternmost mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of the new alignment, which was not affected by the lawsuit. On July 7, 1967, the court ruled 6 – 1 in favor of the Sleepy Hollow Valley Committee. As a result, the western half of the new road was moved an additional mile to the north, bypassing North Tarrytown completely. The new alignment of NY 117 was completed in the early 1970s, and its former alignment along Bedford Road was redesignated as NY 448.

Throughout the afternoon two infantry companies of the PPCLI fought off several attacks by German forces, eventually managing to push them back to the vineyards on the northern edge of the town. While the PPCLI had taken 68 casualties, German casualties were estimated at 120. However, three strong German formation surrounded the Canadian positions at Villa Rogatti, rendering further exploitation of the bridgehead unlikely. Col. Ware was advised to be ready to withdraw across the Moro River, should German forces counterattack. In order to allow the Canadian Division a greater concentration of force, on the night of 7 / 8 December, the Indian 21st Infantry Brigade from the Indian 8th Infantry Division amalgamated the western flank of the 1st Canadian Division into their own lines. As a result of the withdrawal, Canadian efforts would focus on achieving a bridgehead at San Leonardo.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The Canadian attack on San Leonardo by the Seaforth Highlanders of Canada began late on 5 December 1943 with A Company establishing a bridgehead across the Moro, taking heavy casualties. In the early morning of 6 December, A Company was withdrawn and two additional Seaforth companies resumed the offensive. As PPCLI secured and held their bridgehead over the Moro River, the Seaforth Highlanders were struggling to enter San Leonardo. By 07 : 15, a single objective had been taken, with Canadian units pinned down by well @-@ coordinated defensive fire from several companies of the 361st Regiment. Simultaneously, small arms fire prevented C Company from moving up the road from the Moro to San Leonardo, while D Company remained on the southern banks of the Moro throughout the early morning. 
<|endoftext|> In the afternoon, having failed to capture San Leonardo, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment sent two rifle companies to the aid of the Seaforth Highlanders, as Seaforth B Company attacked positions west of San Leonardo — inflicting 129 casualties on German forces in the area. However, the attack on San Leonardo by three Seaforth companies stalled rapidly when the 26th Panzer Regiment's armoured companies reinforced the sector. As a result, <unk> was ordered to prepare for a withdrawal from the San Leonardo bridgehead.

However, the single rifle company making the attack achieved little territorial gain and Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Kennedy — commander of the Hastings & Prince Edward Regiment — ordered a withdrawal at 15 : 40. Throughout 6 December, strong German coastal defences would prevent further advancement, despite the incorporation of tanks and artillery into the assault. By nightfall, the German defenders still possessed control of San Donato, with the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment withdrawing to the southern bank of the Moro River.

While the 48th Highlanders of Canada and Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry resumed the assault on San Leonardo from the southwest side of the town, the Royal Canadian Regiment ( RCR ) would break out of the bridgehead created by the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment, then move southwest towards San Leonardo to link up with the 48th and PPCLI. The operation was scheduled to start on the afternoon of 8 December. 
<|endoftext|> The attack began with a massive artillery barrage which <unk> German positions continuously for two hours. At 16 : 00, the <unk> Light Infantry support battalion joined in, hitting German positions with bursts of machine gun fire. The moment the heavy bombardment lifted, the 48th Highlanders and the RCR both initiated their attacks. D Company of the 48th Highlanders was able to quickly cross the Moro, taking minimal casualties. However, B Company was subjected to heavy fire from German mortars and 88 mm ( 3 @.@ 46 in ) artillery positions. Eventually, however, both companies managed to establish strong positions on the western ridge overlooking San Leonardo. During the night of 8 / 9 December, units of the Royal Canadian Engineers ( <unk> ) constructed a bridge over the Moro, to allow armour and equipment to move into San Leonardo the following day. 
<|endoftext|> As the 48th Highlanders secured their positions west of San Leonardo, the Royal Canadian Regiment was involved in intense fighting southwest of San Donato. Two companies had advanced against strong and well prepared German defences of the 200th Panzergrenadier Regiment.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> It seems that the kakapo – like many of New Zealand's bird species – has evolved to occupy an ecological niche normally filled by various species of mammal ( the only non @-@ marine mammals native to New Zealand are three species of small bats ). Before the arrival of humans, the kakapo was distributed throughout the three main islands of New Zealand. It lived in a variety of habitats, including <unk>, <unk> and coastal areas. It also inhabited forests, including those dominated by <unk> ( rimu, <unk>, <unk>, <unk> ), <unk>, <unk>, and <unk>. In Fiordland, areas of avalanche and slip debris with <unk> and heavily fruiting vegetation – such as five finger, <unk>, bush lawyer, <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> – became known as " kakapo gardens ". 
<|endoftext|> The kakapo is primarily nocturnal ; it roosts under cover in trees or on the ground during the day and moves around its territories at night. 
<|endoftext|> Though the kakapo cannot fly, it is an excellent <unk>, ascending to the crowns of the tallest trees. It can also " parachute " – descending by leaping and spreading its wings. In this way it may travel a few metres ( yards ) at an angle of less than 45 degrees. 
<|endoftext|> Having lost the ability to fly, it has developed strong legs. Movement is often by way of a rapid " <unk> @-@ like " gait by which it can move many kilometres. A female has been observed making two return trips each night during nesting from her nest to a food source up to 1 km ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) away and the male may walk from its home range to a mating arena up to 5 km ( 3 mi ) away during the mating season ( October – January ). 
<|endoftext|> Young birds indulge in play fighting, and one bird will often lock the neck of another under its chin. The kakapo is curious by nature and has been known to interact with humans. Conservation staff and volunteers have engaged extensively with some kakapo, which have distinct personalities. 
<|endoftext|> The kakapo was a very successful species in pre @-@ human New Zealand, and one of the reasons for this was their set of adaptations to effectively avoid predation from native birds of prey, which were their only predators in the past. However, these same <unk> have been of no use to them when faced with the mammalian predators which were introduced to New Zealand after human settlement, because these hunt in different ways. As hunters, birds behave very differently from mammals, relying on their powerful vision to find prey, and thus they usually ( with the exception of owls ) hunt by day. Apart from the two surviving New Zealand raptors, the New Zealand falcon and swamp harrier, there were two other birds of prey in pre @-@ human New Zealand : <unk>'s eagle and <unk>'harrier. All four species soared overhead searching for prey in daylight, and to avoid these avian predators, the kakapo's ancestors adopted camouflaged plumage and became nocturnal. In addition, when the kakapo feels threatened, it freezes, so that it is more effectively camouflaged in the forest vegetation which their plumage resembles. It was not entirely safe at night, when the laughing owl was active, and it is apparent from their nest deposits on Canterbury limestone cliffs that the kakapo was among their prey.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Between 1900 and the 1930s, the number of runs scored by batsmen, and the proportion of lbw dismissals, continued to rise. <unk> grew increasingly frustrated with pad @-@ play and the extent to which batsmen refused to play shots at bowling directed outside the off stump, simply allowing it to pass by. The English fast bowler Harold Larwood responded by targeting leg stump, frequently hitting the batsman with the ball in the process. This developed into the controversial Bodyline tactics he used in Australia in 1932 – 33. Some batsmen began to go further and preferred to kick away balls pitched outside off stump — reaching out to kick the ball instead of allowing it to hit their pads — if they presented any threat, knowing that they could not be dismissed lbw. The authorities believed these developments represented poor entertainment value. At the height of the Bodyline controversy in 1933, Donald Bradman, the leading Australian batsman and primary target of the English bowlers, wrote to the MCC recommending an alteration of the lbw law to create more exciting games. 
<|endoftext|> To address the problem, and <unk> the balance for bowlers, the MCC made some alterations to the laws. The size of the ball was reduced in 1927, and that of the stumps increased in 1931, but the changes had little effect. Between 1929 and 1933, county authorities conducted a trial in which a batsman could be lbw if he had hit the ball onto his pads. Then, in 1935, an experimental law was introduced in which the batsman could be dismissed lbw even if the ball pitched outside the line of off stump — in other words, a ball that turned or swung into the batsman but did not pitch in line with the wickets. However, the ball was still required to strike the batsman in line with the wickets. The umpire signalled to the scorers when he declared a batsman out under the new rule, and any such dismissal was designated " lbw ( n ) " on the <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Several leading batsmen opposed the new law, including the professional Herbert <unk>, known as an exponent of pad @-@ play, and amateurs Errol Holmes and Bob Wyatt. Wisden <unk>'<unk> noted that these three improved their batting records during the 1935 season, but batsmen generally were less successful. There were also fewer drawn matches. There was an increase in the number of lbws — out of 1 @,@ 560 lbw dismissals in first @-@ class matches in 1935, 483 were given under the amended law. Wisden judged the experiment a success and several of its opponents changed their mind by the end of the season ; batsmen soon became accustomed to the alteration. Although Australian authorities were less convinced, and did not immediately introduce the revision into domestic first @-@ class cricket, in 1937 the new rule became part of the Laws of Cricket. 
<|endoftext|> According to Gerald Brodribb, in his survey and history of the Laws, the change produced more " <unk> ", exciting cricket but any alteration in outlook was halted by the Second World War. When the sport resumed in 1946, batsmen were out of practice and the amended lbw law played into the hands of off spin and inswing bowlers, who began to dominate county cricket. The cricket historian Derek <unk> notes that many of these bowlers imitated the methods of Alec <unk>, an inswing bowler who was successful immediately after the war, but that the resulting cricket was <unk> to watch. The revised lbw law, and other alterations in the game in favour of the bowler, further encouraged such bowling. The new law continued to provoke debate among writers and cricketers ; many former players claimed that the alteration had caused a deterioration in batting and reduced the number of shots played on the off side. A 1963 report in The Times blamed the law for reducing the variety of bowling styles : " the change has led to a steady increase in the amount of seam and off @-@ spin bowling. Whereas in the early thirties every county had a leg spinner and an orthodox left arm spinner, leg spinners, at any rate, are now few and far between. Walk on to any of the first @-@ class grounds at any time tomorrow and the chances are that you will see the <unk> standing back and a medium pace bowler in action... there is little doubt that the game, as a spectacle, is less attractive than it was. " Several critics, including Bob Wyatt, maintained that the lbw law should be returned to its pre @-@ 1935 wording ; he campaigned to do so until his death in 1995. On the other hand, Bradman, in the 1950s, proposed extending the law so that batsmen could be lbw even if they were struck outside the line of off stump.

On 5th July 2016, spacecraft Juno arrived and entered the planet's orbit — the second craft ever to do so. <unk> a craft to Jupiter <unk> many technical difficulties, especially due to the probes'large fuel requirements and the effects of the planet's harsh radiation environment. 
<|endoftext|> The first spacecraft to visit Jupiter was Pioneer 10 in 1973, followed a year later by Pioneer 11. Aside from taking the first close @-@ up pictures of the planet, the probes discovered its magnetosphere and its largely fluid interior. The Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 probes visited the planet in 1979, and studied its moons and the ring system, discovering the volcanic activity of Io and the presence of water ice on the surface of Europa. Ulysses further studied Jupiter's magnetosphere in 1992 and then again in 2000. The Cassini probe approached the planet in 2000 and took very detailed images of its atmosphere. The New Horizons spacecraft passed by Jupiter in 2007 and made improved measurements of its and its satellites'parameters. 
<|endoftext|> The Galileo spacecraft was the first to have entered orbit around Jupiter, arriving in 1995 and studying the planet until 2003. During this period Galileo gathered a large amount of information about the Jovian system, making close approaches to all of the four large Galilean moons and finding evidence for thin atmospheres on three of them, as well as the possibility of liquid water beneath their surfaces. It also discovered a magnetic field around Ganymede. As it approached Jupiter, it also witnessed the impact of Comet Shoemaker – Levy 9. In December 1995, it sent an atmospheric probe into the Jovian atmosphere, so far the only craft to do so. 
<|endoftext|> In July 2016, the Juno spacecraft, launched in 2011, completed its orbital insertion maneuver successfully, and is now in orbit around Jupiter and preparing for its science programme.

It requires almost the same amount of energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. In <unk>, this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta @-@ v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an Earth orbit requires a delta @-@ v of about 9 km / s, compared to the 9 @.@ 0 – 9 @.@ 5 km / s to reach a low Earth orbit from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys ( such as by Earth or Venus ) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement ( i.e. the fuel ) at launch, at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory. Ion <unk> capable of a delta @-@ v of more than 10 kilometers / s were used on the Dawn spacecraft. This is more than enough delta @-@ v to do a Jupiter fly @-@ by mission from a solar orbit of the same radius as that of Earth without gravity assist. 
<|endoftext|> A major problem in sending space probes to Jupiter is that the planet has no solid surface on which to land, as there is a smooth transition between the planet's atmosphere and its fluid interior. Any probes descending into the atmosphere are eventually crushed by the immense pressures within Jupiter. 
<|endoftext|> Another major issue is the amount of radiation to which a space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged @-@ particle environment around Jupiter ( for a detailed explanation see <unk> of Jupiter ). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneer's designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed to pass through the radiation belts, but it lost most of the images of the moon Io, as the radiation had caused Pioneer's imaging photo <unk> to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's <unk> often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non @-@ rotating parts, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits.

The staff had previously poked fun at several American institutions on the show and they thought it would be interesting to poke fun at a whole nation. They designed Australia and the Australian people very inaccurately and many things were completely made up for fun. The animators, however, got two Australian tourist guides to help them out with the design of the Australian landscape and buildings, as well as the American Embassy. The writers did research on the Coriolis effect for this episode.

The declaration contributed to a national movement seeking greater civil rights and decentralization of the Yugoslav economy, culminating in the Croatian Spring of 1971, which was suppressed by Yugoslav leadership.

As an example of the latter, the <unk> recording sessions, which again employed <unk> on lead guitar and also as the album's producer, resulted in several notable songs that Dylan left off the album. Best regarded of these were " Blind Willie <unk> ", a tribute to the dead blues musician and an evocation of African American history, " Foot of Pride " and " Lord <unk> My Child ". These three songs were released on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1 – 3 ( Rare & <unk> ) 1961 – 1991. 
<|endoftext|> Between July 1984 and March 1985, Dylan recorded Empire <unk>. Arthur Baker, who had remixed hits for Bruce Springsteen and <unk> <unk>, was asked to engineer and mix the album. Baker said he felt he was hired to make Dylan's album sound " a little bit more contemporary ". 
<|endoftext|> Dylan sang on USA for Africa's famine relief single " We Are the World ". On July 13, 1985, he appeared at the climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of " Hollis Brown ", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people : " I hope that some of the money... maybe they can just take a little bit of it, maybe... one or two million, maybe... and use it to pay the <unk> on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks. " His remarks were widely criticized as inappropriate, but they did inspire Willie Nelson to organize a series of events, Farm Aid, to benefit debt @-@ ridden American farmers. 
<|endoftext|> In April 1986, Dylan made a foray into rap music when he added vocals to the opening verse of " Street Rock ", featured on <unk> Blow's album Kingdom Blow. Dylan's next studio album, <unk> Out <unk>, in July 1986 contained three covers ( by Little Junior Parker, Kris <unk> and the gospel hymn " <unk> Memories " ), plus three collaborations with ( Tom Petty, Sam Shepard and <unk> Bayer <unk> ), and two solo compositions by Dylan. One reviewer commented that " the record follows too many detours to be consistently compelling, and some of those detours wind down roads that are indisputably dead ends. By 1986, such uneven records weren 't entirely unexpected by Dylan, but that didn 't make them any less frustrating. " It was the first Dylan album since Freewheelin'( 1963 ) to fail to make the Top 50. Since then, some critics have called the 11 @-@ minute epic that Dylan co @-@ wrote with Sam Shepard, " <unk> Girl ", a work of genius. 
<|endoftext|> In 1986 and 1987, Dylan toured with Tom Petty and the <unk>, sharing vocals with Petty on several songs each night. Dylan also toured with the <unk> Dead in 1987, resulting in a live album Dylan & The Dead. This received negative reviews : Allmusic said, " Quite possibly the worst album by either Bob Dylan or the <unk> Dead. " Dylan then initiated what came to be called the Never Ending Tour on June 7, 1988, performing with a back @-@ up band featuring guitarist G. E. Smith. Dylan continued to tour with a small, evolving band for the next 20 years. 
<|endoftext|> In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard <unk>'s movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed @-@ up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover, ( Fiona ), leaves him for a <unk> English synth @-@ pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack — " Night After Night ", and " I Had a Dream About You, Baby ", as well as a cover of John <unk>'s " The <unk> ". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, " Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was <unk> physical did not mean that it was anti @-@ intellectual. 
<|endoftext|> The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote : " The very title <unk> any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further <unk> of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.

<|endoftext|>. Three years later, Spain revoked the treaty and in 1800 secretly returned Louisiana to Napoleonic France in the Third Treaty of San <unk>. This transfer was so secret that the Spanish continued to administer the territory. In 1801, Spain restored rights to use the Mississippi and New Orleans to the United States. 
<|endoftext|> Fearing that the <unk> could occur again, President Thomas Jefferson proposed to buy the port of New Orleans from France for $ 10 million. Instead, faced with a debt crisis, Napoleon offered to sell the entirety of Louisiana, including the Missouri River, for $ 15 million – amounting to less than 3 <unk> per acre. The deal was signed in 1803, doubling the size of the United States with the acquisition of the Louisiana Territory. In 1803, Jefferson instructed Meriwether Lewis to explore the Missouri and search for a water route to the Pacific Ocean. By then, it had been discovered that the Columbia River system, which drains into the Pacific, had a similar latitude as the headwaters of the Missouri River, and it was widely believed that a connection or short <unk> existed between the two. However, Spain <unk> at the takeover, citing that they had never formally returned Louisiana to the French. Spanish authorities warned Lewis not to take the journey and forbade him from seeing the MacKay and Evans map of the Missouri, although Lewis eventually managed to gain access to it. 
<|endoftext|> Meriwether Lewis and William Clark began their famed expedition in 1804 with a party of thirty @-@ three people in three boats. Although they became the first Europeans to travel the entire length of the Missouri and reach the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia, they found no trace of the Northwest Passage. The maps made by Lewis and Clark, especially those of the Pacific Northwest region, provided a foundation for future explorers and emigrants. They also negotiated relations with multiple Native American tribes and wrote extensive reports on the climate, ecology and geology of the region. Many present @-@ day names of geographic features in the upper Missouri basin originated from their expedition.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> As early as the 18th century, fur trappers entered the extreme northern basin of the Missouri River in the hopes of finding populations of beaver and river otter, the sale of whose pelts drove the thriving North American fur trade. They came from many different places – some from the Canadian fur corporations at Hudson Bay, some from the Pacific Northwest ( see also : Maritime fur trade ), and some from the <unk> United States. Most did not stay in the area for long, as they failed to find significant resources. 
<|endoftext|> The first glowing reports of country rich with thousands of game animals came in 1806 when Meriwether Lewis and William Clark returned from their two @-@ year expedition. Their journals described lands rich with thousands of buffalo, beaver, and river otter ; and also an abundant population of sea otters on the Pacific Northwest coast. In 1807, explorer Manuel Lisa organized an expedition which would lead to the explosive growth of the fur trade in the upper Missouri River country. Lisa and his crew traveled up the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers, trading manufactured items in return for furs from local Native American tribes, and established a fort at the confluence of the Yellowstone and a tributary, the Bighorn, in southern Montana. Although the business started small, it quickly grew into a thriving trade. 
<|endoftext|> Lisa's men started construction of Fort Raymond, which sat on a bluff overlooking the confluence of the Yellowstone and Bighorn, in the fall of 1807. The fort would serve primarily as a trading post for <unk> with the Native Americans for furs. This method was unlike that of the Pacific Northwest fur trade, which involved trappers hired by the various fur enterprises, namely Hudson's Bay. Fort Raymond was later replaced by Fort Lisa at the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone in North Dakota ; a second fort also called Fort Lisa was built downstream on the Missouri River in Nebraska. In 1809 the St. Louis Missouri Fur Company was founded by Lisa in conjunction with William Clark and Pierre <unk>, among others. In 1828, the American Fur Company founded Fort Union at the confluence of the Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers. Fort Union gradually became the main headquarters for the fur trade in the upper Missouri basin. 
<|endoftext|> Fur trapping activities in the early 19th century encompassed nearly all of the Rocky Mountains on both the eastern and western slopes. <unk> of the Hudson's Bay Company, St. Louis Missouri Fur Company, American Fur Company, Rocky Mountain Fur Company, North West Company and other outfits worked thousands of streams in the Missouri watershed as well as the neighboring Columbia, Colorado, Arkansas, and Saskatchewan river systems. During this period, the trappers, also called mountain men, blazed trails through the wilderness that would later form the

<|endoftext|> " Mothers of the Disappeared " was performed again on the fourth leg of the Vertigo Tour, on 26 February 2006 in Santiago and 2 March in Buenos Aires. Although it was <unk> by the full band, it was played only by Bono and the Edge in an arrangement similar to the one from the PopMart Tour. The Edge performed the song on a <unk> that Chilean President Ricardo <unk> had given to Bono earlier that day. It was played at three concerts on the third leg of the U2 360 ° Tour in place of " <unk> ". One performance in Istanbul, Turkey, was dedicated to <unk> <unk>, an ethnic <unk> who was kidnapped in October 1995 and subsequently disappeared.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> " Mothers of the Disappeared " was favourably received by critics. Steve <unk> of The Boston Globe called the song " powerful " and described the backing vocals as tender and <unk>. Don <unk> of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times described it as a " hymn to human rights ". Adrian <unk> of NME called it " a simple, plaintive lament of stunning beauty and sadness ". Nicholas Jennings of Maclean's felt that it was The Joshua Tree's " most topical song ". Music journalist Andrew Mueller felt the track was a " <unk> <unk> finale ". In Rolling Stone, Steve Pond said "'Mothers of the Disappeared'is built around desolate images of loss, but the setting is <unk> and restorative — music of great sadness but also of <unk> compassion, acceptance and calm. " Lennox <unk> of The Dallas Morning News stated that there was " an <unk> sadness in Bono's vocals and images where'Night hangs like a prisoner / <unk> over black and blue'", calling it " a moving tribute " to people around the world who had lost loved ones to warfare and conflict. He added " [ w ] hat's remarkable about the song is that despite the intrinsic pain, it remains <unk> cleansing. Even in the midst of decay and excess and horror, Bono can find hope and <unk>. " In 2006 Bono described it as " a beautiful end to the album ", saying, " That song means as much to me as any of the songs on that album, it's right up there for me, " and noting that it is a song " I'm very proud of to this day. " 
<|endoftext|> Barbara <unk> of The Bergen Record likened " Mothers of the Disappeared " to " New Year's Day " and " Pride ( In the Name of Love ) ", stating that the band used all three to " stir political consciousness and to urge social commitment. " Thirteen years later, Ryan Jones, in his review of U2's 2000 album All That You Can 't Leave Behind for the same publication, said the song " Peace on Earth " contained echoes of " Mothers of the Disappeared " in its lyrics and the tone of the instrumental prelude. In reviewing the group's 2009 album No Line on the Horizon, Mueller said the closing " <unk> of Lebanon " " maintains this essentially optimistic group's counter @-@ intuitive tradition of ending their albums with <unk> <unk> ", likening it to " Mothers of the Disappeared ". <unk> believed that the song had its roots in " the <unk> purity of traditional Irish music ". According to <unk> the song is " notorious " in Central and South America, and it is often " played as an act of defiance " by the Madres. Art for Amnesty cited the song, and the effect it had in spreading Amnesty International's human rights message, as one of the reasons why U2 were awarded the Ambassador of Conscience Award by the organization in 2005. 
<|endoftext|> Reflecting on the applause given to the Madres during the PopMart concert in Buenos Aires, the U2 magazine Propaganda called the result " about the most moving thing I've ever seen on a rock stage. It was one of those ideas that really could have gone either way, but the obvious empathy of the audience towards these women made it an <unk> moment. " Following the televised concert in Chile, Bono said " it was amazing and <unk> to discover that on our most'pop'of tours some of the best shows were in political <unk> like Santiago, Sarajevo, Tel Aviv... anywhere music meant more than entertainment ".

The historic head of several important <unk> trails and the First Transcontinental Railroad, its center as a national transportation hub earned Omaha the nickname " Gate City of the West " as early as the 1860s. 
<|endoftext|> During a tumultuous pioneer period characterized by its <unk> in proximity to the Western United States, transportation in Omaha demanded the construction of massive warehouses where frontier settlers could stock up and communities west of Omaha got food and supplies to build themselves with. <unk> and stagecoaches jammed the riverside city with a variety of newcomers, prospectors and <unk> characters. Early Omaha also landed the Union Pacific Railroad headquarters, leading to its important place in national railroad lore. 
<|endoftext|> After quickly growing into a city, Omaha failed to pave its streets accordingly. A chaotic transportation system was highlighted by several miles of successful horsecar tracks ; however, the city only ever had four miles ( 6 km ) of cable car service. Several early suburbs were built on reliance of service from these lines, including Dundee, Benson and Kountze Place. In the early 1880s an extensive boulevard system was built to create a park @-@ like atmosphere for drivers throughout the city. The Trans @-@ Mississippi Exposition in 1889 led to the construction of many new transportation features, particularly the magnificent <unk> Station.

Pavarotti was not at the concert to sing his part and so an antique <unk> was brought onto the stage in his place.

That's what these people want, it's what they deserve. " He also speculated that the loss of his voice had " allowed room for Sarajevo to take the gig away from us.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The reaction mechanism for the Johnson – Corey – Chaykovsky reaction consists of nucleophilic addition of the ylide to the <unk> or <unk> group. A negative charge is transferred to the <unk> and because the sulfonium cation is a good leaving group it gets expelled forming the ring. In the related <unk> reaction, the formation of the much stronger phosphorus @-@ oxygen double bond prevents <unk> formation and instead, <unk> takes place through a 4 @-@ membered cyclic intermediate. 
<|endoftext|> The trans diastereoselectivity observed results from the reversibility of the initial addition, allowing <unk> to the favored anti betaine over the <unk> betaine. Initial addition of the ylide results in a betaine with adjacent charges ; density functional theory calculations have shown that the rate @-@ limiting step is rotation of the central bond into the <unk> necessary for <unk> attack on the sulfonium. 
<|endoftext|> The degree of reversibility in the initial step ( and therefore the diastereoselectivity ) depends on four factors, with greater reversibility corresponding to higher selectivity :

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Types of ylides = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Many types of ylides can be prepared with various functional groups both on the <unk> carbon center and on the sulfur. The substitution pattern can influence the ease of preparation for the reagents ( typically from the sulfonium <unk>, e.g. <unk> iodide ) and overall reaction rate in various ways. The general format for the reagent is shown on the right. 
<|endoftext|> Use of a sulfoxonium allows more <unk> preparation of the reagent using weaker bases as compared to sulfonium ylides. ( The difference being that a sulfoxonium contains a <unk> bonded oxygen whereas the sulfonium does not. ) The former react slower due to their increased stability. In addition, the <unk> by @-@ products of sulfoxonium reagents are greatly preferred to the significantly more toxic, volatile, and <unk> <unk> by @-@ products from sulfonium reagents.

For these, the related <unk> reaction is typically more appropriate. 
<|endoftext|> If the ylide carbon is substituted with an <unk> or <unk> group, the reagent is referred to as a semi @-@ stabilized ylide.

Along a horizontal plane, eye movement can be maintained even if the head is rotated up or down to an angle of up to 45 °. If the head is rotated 360 °, one eye will tilt up and the other down, depending on the direction of rotation. Also, if one eye looks forward, the other looks back, as if both are connected to a fixed position on an axis between them. In general, the eyes often flick back and forth in a rapid and <unk> manner. When asleep, there is no eye movement and the pupils are strongly contracted. The pupils <unk> suddenly and eye movement resumes when the animal wakes up.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Because of their large, heavy body size, the adults have no trouble eating prey as large as fully grown rabbits. When prey happens by, they strike with very fast precision from any angle. Once they strike their prey, they hang on to it with their large fangs rather than letting it go and waiting for it to die. This behaviour is very different from the behaviour of other species of vipers. These snakes feed on a variety of birds and mammals, such as <unk>, many different species of rodents, including field mice and rats, as well as hares and rabbits.

Their bodies intertwine as they switch positions. They become oblivious to everything else, continuing even after they fall off a surface or into water.

Due to the opposition from Jeremi's detractors, he was not granted a hetman position, although after a full two days of debate on the subject he was granted a document that stated he had a " power equal to that of a hetman.

Wiśniowiecki's arrival raised the morale of the royal army, and despite having no official rank, both the common soldiers and the new regimentarz promised to take his advice, and even offered him the official command ( which he refused ). During the Siege of Zbarazh Wiśniowiecki was thus not the official commander ( role was taken by regimentarz Andrzej <unk> ) but most historians agree he was the real, if unofficial, commander of the Polish @-@ Lithuanian army. The siege would last until the ceasefire of the Treaty of <unk>. Wiśniowiecki's command during the siege was seen as phenomenal, and his popularity among the troops and nobility rose again, however the King, still not fond of him, gave him a relatively small reward ( the land grant of <unk> <unk>, much less when compared to several others he distributed around that time ). <unk> Wiśniowiecki's support in December that year, the King granted him once again a temporary hetman nomination, and several more land grants.

Literary critic Christopher Ricks published a 500 @-@ page analysis of Dylan's work, placing him in the context of Eliot, Keats and Tennyson, claiming that Dylan was a poet worthy of the same close analysis. Former British poet laureate Sir Andrew Motion argued that his lyrics should be studied in schools. Since 1996, academics have lobbied the Swedish Academy to award Dylan the Nobel Prize in Literature. 
<|endoftext|> Dylan's voice also received critical attention. New York Times critic Robert Shelton described his early vocal style as " a rusty voice suggesting Guthrie's old performances, etched in gravel like Dave Van Ronk's. " David Bowie, in his tribute, " Song for Bob Dylan ", described Dylan's singing as " a voice like sand and glue ". His voice continued to develop as he began to work with rock 'n'roll backing bands ; critic Michael Gray described the sound of Dylan's vocal work on " Like a Rolling Stone " as " at once young and <unk> cynical ". As Dylan's voice aged during the 1980s, for some critics, it became more expressive. Christophe <unk> writes in the journal Oral Tradition, " Dylan's more recent broken voice enables him to present a world view at the sonic surface of the songs — this voice carries us across the landscape of a broken, fallen world. The anatomy of a broken world in " Everything is Broken " ( on the album Oh Mercy ) is but an example of how the thematic concern with all things broken is grounded in a concrete sonic reality. " 
<|endoftext|> Dylan is considered a seminal influence on several musical genres, especially folk rock, country rock and Christian rock. As Edna Gundersen stated in USA Today : " Dylan's musical DNA has informed nearly every simple twist of pop since 1962. " Punk musician Joe <unk> praised Dylan for having " laid down the template for lyric, tune, seriousness, spirituality, depth of rock music. " Other major musicians who acknowledged Dylan's importance include Johnny Cash, Jerry Garcia, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Pete <unk>, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen, David Bowie, Bryan Ferry, Nick Cave, Patti Smith, Syd Barrett Joni Mitchell, and Tom <unk>. Dylan significantly contributed to the initial success of both the Byrds and the Band : the Byrds achieved chart success with their version of " Mr. <unk> Man " and the subsequent album, while the Band were Dylan's backing band on his 1966 tour, recorded The Basement Tapes with him in 1967, and featured three previously unreleased Dylan songs on their debut album. 
<|endoftext|> Some critics have <unk> from the view of Dylan as a visionary figure in popular music. In his book <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk> objected : " I can 't take the vision of Dylan as seer, as teenage <unk>, as everything else he's been worshipped as.

" 
<|endoftext|> Fellow musicians also presented dissenting views. Joni Mitchell described Dylan as a " <unk> " and his voice as " fake " in a 2010 interview in the Los Angeles Times, in response to a suggestion that she and Dylan were similar since they had both created personas. Mitchell's comment led to discussions of Dylan's use of other people's material, both supporting and criticizing him. In 2013 Mitchell told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation ( <unk> ) in an interview that her remarks in the Los Angeles Times had been taken " completely out of context ", and that the interviewer was a " <unk> ".

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Thunderbirds is generally considered the Andersons'most popular series and their greatest critical and commercial success. In 1966, the show received a Royal Television Society Silver Medal for Outstanding Artistic Achievement and Gerry Anderson received an honorary <unk> of the British <unk>, Sound and Television Society. In 2007, Thunderbirds achieved 19th place in a Radio Times magazine reader poll to determine the best science @-@ fiction TV programme of all time. It is ranked fourth by the 2013 Channel 5 list show 50 Greatest Kids'TV <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> For Peel, Thunderbirds is " without a doubt the peak of the Supermarionation achievement ". Suggesting that the series is pitched at a " more adult " level than its predecessors, he adds that its sense of adventure, effective humour and " gripping and convincing " episodes ensured that " everyone in the audience found something to love about it. " Simon <unk>, a fan of Thunderbirds in childhood, commented positively on the series for The Daily Telegraph in 2011 : " All the elements we children discerned in whatever grown @-@ up television we had been allowed to watch were present in Thunderbirds : dramatic theme and incidental music ; well @-@ developed plots ; <unk> and <unk> ; <unk> Americans, at a time when the whole of Britain was in a cultural <unk> to them ; and, of course, glamorous locations... Then, of course, there was the nail @-@ biting tension of the rescues themselves... " Film critic Kim Newman describes the series as a " television perennial ". 
<|endoftext|> In his <unk> to John Marriott's book, Thunderbirds Are Go!, Anderson put forward several explanations for the series'enduring popularity : it " contains elements that appeal to most children – danger, jeopardy and destruction. But because International Rescue's mission is to save life, there is no <unk> violence. " According to Anderson, Thunderbirds incorporates a " strong family atmosphere, where Dad <unk> supreme ". Both O 'Brien and script editor Alan Pattillo have praised the series'positive " family values ". In addition, <unk> and others have written of its cross @-@ <unk> appeal. In 2000, shortly before the series'BBC revival, Brian <unk> remarked in Radio Times that Thunderbirds was on the point of " captivating yet another generation of viewers ". Stuart Hood, writing for The Spectator in 1965, praised Thunderbirds as a " modern fairy tale " ; adding that it " can sometimes be frightening ", he recommended that children watch it accompanied by their parents. Writing for <unk> in 1994, Andrew Thomas described Thunderbirds as only " nominally " a children's programme : " Its themes are universal and speak as much to the adult in the child as the child in the adult. " 
<|endoftext|> Jeff Evans, author of The Penguin TV Companion, argues that the series'50 @-@ minute format allows for stronger character development and " tension @-@ building ". O 'Brien is less positive in his appraisal of the writing, asserting that the plots are often " formulaic " and are sometimes " stretched to snapping point " by the extended running time.

The first Braathens SAFE flight was made on 24 February from Oslo, landing at Amsterdam, Marseille, Cairo, Basra, Karachi, <unk> and Bangkok before Hong Kong, where Norske <unk> landed on 8 March. Total flight time was 46 hours. Along the route, Braathens SAFE established contracts with agents, or stationed their own employees. 
<|endoftext|> The regular services could be done with a round trip time of nine to ten days, including <unk> in Cairo, Karachi and Bangkok, and with technical revision of the plane in Hong Kong. At first there were <unk> services, but by the end of 1947, these had increased to weekly. In June, Braathens SAFE bought a Douglas DC @-@ 3, LN @-@ PAS Norse Carrier, and in August another DC @-@ 4, LN @-@ <unk> Norse Commander, both from KLM. In 1947, Braathens SAFE flew twenty @-@ five trips to Hong Kong, five to New York and one to Johannesburg, South Africa, making a profit of NOK 750 @,@ 000. The following year, Braathens SAFE started the first trial flights to South America. The first flight was made on 23 August from Stavanger via Reykjavík, <unk> and Bermuda to <unk>, where the plane landed on 26 August. In October, the airline flew to Panama, but neither route gave sufficient contracts to commence regular services. In 1948, the airline made fifty trips to Hong Kong, eight to Johannesburg, two to the United States, three to Venezuela and two to Panama.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> During World War II, the civil aviation planning was conducted by the Aviation Council. In 1945, they started a limited number of flights that were operated by the Royal Norwegian Air Force. On 2 July 1946, the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, several large shipping companies and other private investors reestablished <unk> Norske <unk> ( DNL ), with the state owning 20 % and the shipping companies 49 %. This airline was granted a 20 @-@ year monopoly on domestic and international flights. According to the concession, only routes that DNL were not willing to fly themselves, could be granted to other airlines. 
<|endoftext|> By 1948, Braathens SAFE's routes were so regular that several countries stated that a bilateral agreement would have to be negotiated for them to continue. However, the concession that had been granted to DNL did not allow Braathens to fly any scheduled flights. Braathens SAFE applied for fifteen @-@ year concession on 5 February 1948 ; Minister of Transport Nils Langhelle from the Labor Party knew that he would be violating DNL's concession by granting Braathens SAFE a concession, but at the same time he was worried that Braathens SAFE could easily flag out to another country, from which DNL would receive no protection. The exception in DNL's concession could not be used, since DNL declared that they, through the Scandinavian cooperation Scandinavian Airlines System ( SAS ), were planning to start a route to the far east. The Directorate for Civil Aviation stated that it was unlikely that DNL / SAS would start such a route within a few years, and recommended Langhelle that Braathens SAFE be granted the route. Concession was granted by the Norwegian Parliament on 3 February 1949, with a duration of five years. The airline had to follow the route Oslo or Stavanger – Amsterdam – Geneva – Rome – Cairo – Basra – Karachi – Bombay – Calcutta – Bangkok – Hong Kong. The concession was made conditional that Braathens SAFE built a technical base at Stavanger Airport, Sola. 
<|endoftext|> The Hong Kong @-@ route was officially opened on 5 August 1949. Braathens SAFE had then moved its operative base from Gardermoen to Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The company stationed technical employees in Rome, Karachi, Bangkok and Hong Kong, as well as having an agreement with KLM. The planes would stop each night and crew and passengers would stay at a hotel. Cabin crew had no training, and learned the job as they worked. <unk> was the most common lunch meal, and the cabin crew had to purchase this fresh each day, usually observing the slaughter to ensure its freshness. In 1949, sixty @-@ seven flights were made to Hong Kong, as well as two to Tokyo, to Venezuela and one to Johannesburg.

Lacking the support of infantry or heavy artillery, the mounted force was too small to capture this strong rearguard position, but the threat from the mounted advance was enough to force the hostile force to evacuate the position. During the night, the German and Ottoman forces retreated back to Bir el Abd, where they had been three weeks before, on 20 July, when they established a base with a depot for supplies and stores. 
<|endoftext|> On 7 August the Greater <unk> ( a feast day celebrating the end of the Islamic year ) coincided with the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps at Romani being ordered to move out with supplies for the advancing troops, but 150 men, most of whom were past the end of their contracts and entitled to be discharged, refused orders to fill their water bottles, draw their rations and saddle up.

Alvarez Borland explains that the advantage of this technique, as discussed by Walter <unk>, is that " the <unk> of any given culture, residing in the unwritten tales of its peoples, possesses a spontaneity and <unk> which is lost once this culture commits its tales to writing. " The oral style of narration therefore provides a <unk> which official history lacks. Alvarez Borland concludes that The General in His Labyrinth suggests new ways of writing the past ; it takes account of voices that were never written down as part of official history. 
<|endoftext|> The historian Ben Hughes commented on the novel : " The Liberator's British <unk>, including Daniel O 'Leary, were amongst the closest figures to the general in this period. Nevertheless, they are ignored in the novel. Instead, Márquez uses the character of a fictional Colombian servant, José Palacios, as The Liberator's final sounding board, thereby <unk> <unk> the more complex reality. " In Hughes's view modern South American literature has played a role in cleansing the national memory of British soldiers'assistance to The Liberator.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In an interview published in the Colombian weekly <unk> <unk> on March 20, 1989, García Márquez told María Elvira <unk>, " At bottom, I have written only one book, the same one that circles round and round, and continues on.

<|endoftext|> Like the Patriarch in García Márquez's The Autumn of the Patriarch, Bolívar was an absolute dictator. The Patriarch is never identified by name ; Bolívar, too, is identified chiefly by his title. Bolívar also invites comparison with Colonel <unk> <unk> in One Hundred Years of Solitude : both characters believe the wars they have <unk> have been fruitless and overwhelming, and both face numerous attempts on their lives, but eventually die of natural causes. In his belief that life is controlled by fate, the General resembles <unk> in One Hundred Years of Solitude and Santiago <unk> in Chronicle of a Death <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Palencia @-@ Roth notes that critics have been struck by the <unk> elegiac style of The General in His Labyrinth ; its dark mood and somber message is similar to that of The Autumn of the Patriarch. Love is a theme common to both Love in the Time of Cholera and The General in His Labyrinth, but the latter is considered a tragedy. These two novels have been used to demonstrate the range of García Márquez's work. 
<|endoftext|> Isabel Alvarez Borland, in her essay " The Task of the Historian in El general en su laberinto ", claims that "... while El general en su laberinto is in many ways a continuation of García Márquez's criticism of Latin America's official history seen in his earlier works, the novel contrasts sharply with his previous <unk> ". In Chronicle of a Death <unk>, according to Alvarez Borland, the narrator challenges the truth of official language. However, The General in His Labyrinth " differs from these earlier works in employing narrative strategies which seek to answer in a much more overt and <unk> fashion questions that the novel poses about history ". 
<|endoftext|> In a summary of Edward Hood's book La <unk> de Gabriel García Márquez : <unk> e <unk>, García Márquez is characterized as an author who uses repetition and <unk> ( <unk> between the works of a single author ) extensively in his fiction, including in The General in His Labyrinth. Hood points out some obvious examples of repetition in García Márquez's works : the themes of solitude in One Hundred Years of Solitude, <unk> in Autumn of the Patriarch, and the desire for a unified continent expressed by Bolívar in The General in His Labyrinth. An example of <unk> can be seen in the repetition of patterns between books. For example, both Jose <unk> <unk> in One Hundred Years of Solitude and Bolívar in The General in his Labyrinth experience <unk> dreams.

<|endoftext|> options it held on the river to lapse — including an option for what became the site of Hoover Dam. 
<|endoftext|> In the following years, the Bureau of Reclamation ( BOR ), known as the Reclamation Service at the time, also considered the Lower Colorado as the site for a dam. Service chief Arthur Powell Davis proposed using dynamite to collapse the walls of Boulder Canyon, 20 miles ( 32 km ) north of the eventual dam site, into the river. The river would carry off the smaller pieces of debris, and a dam would be built incorporating the remaining rubble. In 1922, after considering it for several years, the Reclamation Service finally rejected the proposal, citing doubts about the unproven technique and questions as to whether it would in fact save money. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Planning and agreements = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In 1922, the Reclamation Service presented a report calling for the development of a dam on the Colorado River for flood control and electric power generation. The report was principally authored by Davis, and was called the Fall @-@ Davis report after Interior Secretary Albert Fall. The Fall @-@ Davis report cited use of the Colorado River as a federal concern, because the river's basin covered several states, and the river eventually entered Mexico. Though the Fall @-@ Davis report called for a dam " at or near Boulder Canyon ", the Reclamation Service ( which was renamed the Bureau of Reclamation the following year ) found that canyon unsuitable. One potential site at Boulder Canyon was <unk> by a geologic fault ; two others were so narrow there was no space for a construction camp at the bottom of the canyon or for a spillway. The Service investigated Black Canyon and found it ideal ; a railway could be laid from the railhead in Las Vegas to the top of the dam site. Despite the site change, the dam project was referred to as the " Boulder Canyon Project ". 
<|endoftext|> With little guidance on water allocation from the Supreme Court, proponents of the dam feared endless litigation. A Colorado attorney proposed that the seven states which fell within the river's basin ( California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado and Wyoming ) form an <unk> compact, with the approval of Congress. Such <unk> were authorized by Article I of the United States Constitution but had never been concluded among more than two states. In 1922, representatives of seven states met with then @-@ Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. Initial talks produced no result, but when the Supreme Court handed down the Wyoming v. Colorado decision <unk> the claims of the upstream states, they became anxious to reach an agreement. The resulting Colorado River Compact was signed on November 24, 1922. 
<|endoftext|> Legislation to authorize the dam was introduced repeatedly by Representative Phil Swing ( R @-@ <unk>. ) and Senator <unk> Johnson ( R @-@ <unk>. ), but representatives from other parts of the country considered the project as hugely expensive and one that would mostly benefit California. The 1927 Mississippi flood made Midwestern and Southern <unk> and <unk> more sympathetic toward the dam project. On March 12, 1928, the failure of the St. Francis Dam, constructed by the city of Los Angeles, caused a disastrous flood that killed up to 600 people. As that dam was a curved @-@ gravity type, similar in design to the arch @-@ gravity as was proposed for the Black Canyon dam, opponents claimed that the Black Canyon dam's safety could not be guaranteed. Congress authorized a board of engineers to review plans for the proposed dam. The Colorado River Board found the project feasible, but warned that should the dam fail, every downstream Colorado River community would be destroyed, and that the river might change course and empty into the <unk> Sea. The Board cautioned : " To avoid such possibilities, the proposed dam should be constructed on conservative if not ultra @-@ conservative lines. " 
<|endoftext|> On December 21, 1928 President <unk> signed the bill authorizing the dam. The Boulder Canyon Project Act appropriated $ 165 million for the Hoover Dam along with the downstream Imperial Dam and All @-@ American Canal, a replacement for Beatty's canal entirely on the U.S. side of the border. It also permitted the compact to go into effect when at least six of the seven states approved it. This occurred on March 6, 1929 with Utah's ratification ; Arizona did not approve it until 1944.

It was called the Overseas Province of Mozambique ( <unk> <unk> de Moçambique ). Nonetheless, Portugal still maintained strong control over its overseas province. The increasing number of newly independent African nations after World War II, coupled with the ongoing mistreatment of the indigenous population, encouraged the growth of nationalist sentiments within Mozambique. 
<|endoftext|> Mozambique was marked by large <unk> between the wealthy Portuguese and the majority of the large rural indigenous African population. <unk> whites, many of them recent immigrants, including illiterate peasants, were given preference in lower @-@ level urban jobs, where a system of job reservation existed. In the rural areas, Portuguese controlled the trading stores with which African peasants interacted. Being largely illiterate and preserving their local traditions and ways of life, skilled employment opportunities and roles in administration and government were rare for these numerous tribal populations, leaving them few or no opportunities in the urban modern life. Many indigenous peoples saw their culture and tradition being overwhelmed by the alien culture of Portugal. A small educated African class did emerge, but faced substantial discrimination. 
<|endoftext|> Vocal political dissidents opposed to Portuguese rule and claiming independence were typically forced into exile. From the mid @-@ 1920s a succession of authoritarian regimes in Portugal closed unions and left @-@ wing opposition, both within Portugal and within its colonies, notably in the <unk> Novo period ( 1933 @-@ 1974 ). The Portuguese government forced black Mozambican farmers to grow rice or cotton for export, providing little return with which the farmers could support themselves. Many other workers — over 250 @,@ 000 by 1960 — were pressured to work on coal and gold mines, in neighbouring territories, mainly in South Africa, where they comprised over 30 % of black underground miners. By 1950, only 4 @,@ 353 Mozambicans out of 5 @,@ 733 @,@ 000 had been granted the right to vote by the Portuguese colonial government.

It was only in exile that such political movements could develop, due to the strength of Portugal's grip on <unk> activity within Mozambique itself.

Many wealthy Argentines did this, but there are many more convenient and less conspicuous ways of depositing money in Swiss accounts than meeting the Swiss Foreign Minister and being shown around a watch factory.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The Sociedad de <unk> ( Society of <unk> ), a charity group made up of 87 society ladies, was responsible for most charity works in Buenos Aires prior to the election of Juan Perón. Fraser and Navarro write that at one point the Sociedad had been an enlightened institution, caring for orphans and homeless women, but that those days had long since passed by the time of the first term of Juan Perón. In the 1800s, the Sociedad had been supported by private contributions, largely those of the husbands of the society ladies. But by the 1940s, the Sociedad was supported by the government. 
<|endoftext|> It had been the tradition of the Sociedad to elect the First Lady of Argentina as president of the charity. But the ladies of the Sociedad did not approve of Eva Perón's impoverished background, lack of formal education, and former career as an actress. Fraser and Navarro write that the ladies of the Sociedad were afraid that Evita would set a bad example for the orphans, therefore the society ladies did not extend to Evita the position of president of their organization. It has often been said that Evita had the government funding for the Sociedad cut off in retaliation. Fraser and Navarro suggest that this version of events is in dispute, but that the government funding that had previously supported the Sociedad now went to support Evita's own foundation. The <unk> María Eva Duarte de Perón was created on 8 July 1948. It was later renamed to, simply, the Eva Perón Foundation. Its funding began with 10 @,@ 000 pesos provided by Evita herself. 
<|endoftext|> In The Woman with the Whip, the first English language biography of Eva Perón, author Mary Main writes that no account records were kept for the foundation because it was merely a means of <unk> government money into private Swiss bank accounts controlled by the Peróns. Fraser and Navarro, however, counter these claims, writing that Ramón <unk>, Minister of Finance, kept records, and that the foundation " began as the simplest response to the poverty ( Evita ) encountered each day in her office " and " the appalling <unk> of social services — or charity, as it was still called — in Argentina.

<|endoftext|> Lake Mead began February 1, 1935, even before the last of the concrete was poured that May. The powerhouse was one of the projects uncompleted at the time of the formal dedication on September 30, 1935 — a crew of 500 men remained to finish it and other structures. To make the powerhouse roof <unk>, it was constructed of layers of concrete, rock, and steel with a total thickness of about 3 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ), topped with layers of sand and tar. 
<|endoftext|> In the latter half of 1936, water levels in Lake Mead were high enough to permit power generation, and the first three <unk> <unk> built Francis turbine @-@ generators, all on the Nevada side, began operating. In March 1937, one more Nevada generator went online and the first Arizona generator by August. By September 1939, four more generators were operating, and the dam's power plant became the largest <unk> facility in the world. The final generator was not placed in service until 1961, bringing the maximum generating capacity to 1 @,@ 345 megawatts at the time. Original plans called for 16 large generators, eight on each side of the river, but two smaller generators were installed instead of one large one on the Arizona side for a total of 17. The smaller generators were used to serve smaller communities at a time when the output of each generator was dedicated to a single municipality, before the dam's total power output was placed on the grid and made <unk> <unk>. The present contracts for the sale of electricity <unk> in 2017. 
<|endoftext|> Before water from Lake Mead reaches the turbines, it enters the intake towers and then four gradually narrowing <unk> which funnel the water down towards the powerhouse. The <unk> provide a maximum hydraulic head ( water pressure ) of 590 ft ( 180 m ) as the water reaches a speed of about 85 mph ( 140 km / h ). The entire flow of the Colorado River passes through the turbines. The spillways and outlet works ( jet @-@ flow gates ) are rarely used. The jet @-@ flow gates, located in concrete structures 180 feet ( 55 m ) above the river, and also at the outlets of the inner diversion tunnels at river level, may be used to divert water around the dam in emergency or flood conditions, but have never done so, and in practice are only used to drain water from the <unk> for maintenance. Following an <unk> project from 1986 to 1993, the total gross power rating for the plant, including two 2 @.@ 4 <unk> <unk> turbine @-@ generators that power Hoover Dam's own operations is a maximum capacity of <unk> megawatts. The annual generation of Hoover Dam varies. The maximum net generation was 10 @.@ 348 TWh in 1984, and the minimum since 1940 was 2 @.@ 648 TWh in 1956. The average power generated was 4 @.@ 2 TWh / year for 1947 @-@ 2008. In 2015, the dam generated 3 @.@ 6 TWh. To lower the minimum power pool elevation from 1 @,@ 050 to 950 feet ( 320 to 290 m ), five wide @-@ head turbines, designed to work efficiently with less flow, will be online by 2017. Due to lack of water, the dam mostly provides power only during periods of peak demand. 
<|endoftext|> Control of water was the primary concern in the building of the dam. Power generation has allowed the dam project to be self @-@ sustaining : proceeds from the sale of power repaid the 50 @-@ year construction loan, and those revenues also finance the <unk> @-@ dollar yearly maintenance budget. Power is generated in step with and only with the release of water in response to downstream water demands. 
<|endoftext|> Lake Mead and downstream releases from the dam also provide water for both municipal and irrigation uses. Water released from the Hoover Dam eventually reaches several canals. The Colorado River <unk> and Central Arizona Project branch off Lake <unk> while the All @-@ American Canal is supplied by the Imperial Dam. In total, water from the Lake Mead serves 18 million people in Arizona, Nevada and California and supplies the irrigation of over 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ( 400 @,@ 000 ha ) of land.

<|endoftext|> The Church leaders of later centuries inscribed Sunday rest into official Church teaching, and Christian governments have attempted to enforce the Sunday rest throughout history. For Catholics, Jesus'teaching that " the <unk> was made for man, not man for the <unk> " means that good works " when the needs of others demand it " can be part of the day of rest. The Catechism offers guidelines on how to observe the Lord's Day, which include attending Mass on Sundays and holy days of obligation. On these days, Catholics may not work or do activities that " hinder the worship due to God ", but " performance of the works of mercy, and appropriate relaxation in a spirit of joy " are permitted.

It strengthens <unk> relationships, makes explicit the connection between family order and societal stability, and reveals that the family is " both willed and protected by God. " Because parents'unconditional love for their children mirrors God's love, and because they have a duty to pass the faith on to their children, the Catechism calls the family " a domestic church ", " a privileged community " and the " original cell of social life ". 
<|endoftext|> The Catechism says this commandment requires duties of children to parents that include : 
<|endoftext|> Respect toward parents that also flows to brothers and sisters.

" Pope Benedict XVI stated that this <unk> of Jesus brought the fourth commandment to a new and higher level. By doing God's will, any person can become part of the universal family of Jesus. Thus, the fourth commandment's responsibilities extend to the greater society and requires respect for " legitimate social authorities ". The Catechism specifies " duties of citizens and nations ", which Kreeft <unk> as : 
<|endoftext|> long " followed by " short " and followed by " long ". This alteration is continued in longer lines, including line 31 ( " Away! away! for I will fly to thee " ) which contains five pairs of <unk>. However, other lines, such as line 3 ( " Or emptied some dull <unk> to the drains " ) rely on a pattern of five " short " vowels followed by " long " and " short " vowel <unk> until they end with a " long " vowel. These are not the only combination patterns present, and there are patterns of two " short " vowels followed by a " long " vowel in other lines, including 12, 22, and 59, which are repeated twice and then followed up with two sets of " short " and then " long " vowel pairs. This reliance on vowel sounds is not unique to this ode, but is common to Keats's other 1819 odes and his Eve of St. Agnes. 
<|endoftext|> The poem incorporates a complex reliance on assonance — the repetition of vowel sounds — in a conscious pattern, as found in many of his poems. Such a reliance on assonance is found in very few English poems. Within " Ode to a Nightingale ", an example of this pattern can be found in line 35 ( " Already with thee! tender is the night " ), where the " <unk> " of " Already " connects with the " e " of " tender " and the " i " of " with " connects with the " i " of " is ". This same pattern is found again in line 41 ( " I cannot see what flowers are at my feet " ) with the " a " of " cannot " linking with the " a " of " at " and the " ee " of " see " linking with the " ee " of " feet ". This system of assonance can be found in approximately a tenth of the lines of Keats's later poetry. 
<|endoftext|> When it came to other sound patterns, Keats relied on double or triple <unk> in approximately 6 % of lines throughout the 1819 odes. An example from " Ode to a Nightingale " can be found within line 45 ( " The grass, the thicket, and the fruit @-@ tree wild " ) as the <unk> after the commas are a " masculine " pause. Furthermore, Keats began to reduce the amount of Latin @-@ based words and <unk> that he relied on in his poetry, which in turn shortened the length of the words that dominate the poem. There is also an emphasis on words beginning with consonants, especially those that begin with " b ", " p " or " v ". These three consonants are relied on heavily in the first stanza, and they are used <unk> to add a musical tone within the poem. 
<|endoftext|> In terms of poetic meter, Keats relies on <unk> throughout his 1819 odes and in just over 8 % of his lines within " Ode to a Nightingale ", including line 12 :

<|endoftext|> Despite its deceptive simplicity in rhyme and meter, " Trees " is notable for its use of personification and anthropomorphic imagery : the tree of the poem, which Kilmer depicts as female, is depicted as pressing its mouth to the Earth's breast, looking at God, and raising its " leafy arms " to pray. The tree of the poem also has human physical attributes — it has a " hungry mouth ", arms, hair ( in which robins nest ), and a <unk>.

Although the systems differ in appearance, all three are <unk>, their letters share the same names and <unk> order, and are written horizontally following the standard left @-@ to @-@ right direction. Of the three Georgian writing systems, Mkhedruli ( literally meaning " cavalry " or " military " script ) was the civilian royal script of the Georgian Kingdom used for charters, historical documents, manuscripts and inscriptions. Mkhedruli is therefore the standard script for modern Georgian and its related Kartvelian languages, whereas Asomtavruli and Nuskhuri are used only in ceremonial religious texts and iconography. 
<|endoftext|> Georgian scripts are unique in their appearance and their exact origin has never been established ; however, in strictly structural terms, their <unk> order largely corresponds to the Greek alphabet, with the exception of letters denoting uniquely Georgian sounds, which are grouped at the end. Originally consisting of 38 letters, Georgian is presently written in a 33 @-@ letter alphabet, as five letters are currently obsolete in that language. The number of Georgian letters used in other Kartvelian languages varies.

That same obsolete letter, plus a letter borrowed from Greek ( making 35 letters total ), are used in writing the Laz language. The fourth Kartvelian language, Svan, is not commonly written, but when it is, it uses Georgian letters as utilized in Mingrelian, with an additional obsolete Georgian letter and sometimes supplemented by <unk> for its many vowels.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The origins of the Georgian script are to this date poorly known, and no full agreement exists among Georgian and foreign scholars as to its date of creation, who designed the script and the main influences on that process. 
<|endoftext|> The first version of the script attested is Asomtavruli which dates back to at least the 5th century ; the other scripts were formed in the following centuries. Most scholars link the creation of the Georgian alphabet to the process of Christianisation of a core Georgian @-@ speaking kingdom, that is, <unk> ( or Iberia in Classical sources ). The alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of Iberia under King <unk> III ( 326 or 337 ) and the Bir el <unk> inscriptions of 430, <unk> with the Armenian alphabet. It was first used for translation of the Bible and other Christian literature into Georgian, by monks in Georgia and Palestine. Professor <unk> <unk>'s dating of fragmented Asomtavruli inscriptions, discovered by him at the ruined town of <unk>, in Georgia's easternmost province of <unk>, in the 1980s, to the 1st or 2nd century has not been universally accepted. 
<|endoftext|> A Georgian tradition first attested in the medieval chronicle Lives of the Kings of <unk> ( ca. 800 ), assigns a much earlier, pre @-@ Christian origin to the Georgian alphabet, and names King <unk> I ( 3rd century BC ) as its inventor. This account is now considered legendary, and is rejected by scholarly consensus, as no archaeological confirmation has been found. <unk> considers the tradition to be an attempt by the Georgian Church to <unk> the earlier tradition that the alphabet was invented by <unk> Mashtots, and is a Georgian application of an Iranian model in which primordial kings are credited with the creation of basic social institutions. Georgian linguist <unk> <unk> offers an alternate interpretation of the tradition, in the pre @-@ Christian use of foreign scripts ( <unk> in the Aramaic alphabet ) to write down Georgian texts. 
<|endoftext|> A point of contention among scholars is the role played by Armenian clerics in that process. According to a number of scholars and medieval Armenian sources, <unk> Mashtots, generally acknowledged as the creator of the Armenian alphabet, also created the Georgian and Caucasian <unk> alphabets. This tradition originates in the works of Koryun, a fifth century historian and biographer of Mashtots, and has been quoted by

These hatch in 19 – 20 days, and the black precocial chicks fledge after about five weeks. This crake is in steep decline across much of its former breeding range because modern farming practices often destroy nests before breeding is completed. The corn crake is omnivorous but mainly feeds on invertebrates, the occasional small frog or mammal, and plant material including grass seed and cereal grain. Natural threats include introduced and feral mammals, large birds, various parasites and diseases. 
<|endoftext|> Although numbers have declined steeply in western Europe, this bird is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List because of its huge range and large, apparently stable, populations in Russia and Kazakhstan. Numbers in western China are more significant than previously thought, and conservation measures have facilitated an increased population in some countries which had suffered the greatest losses. Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The rails are a bird family comprising nearly 150 species. Although origins of the group are lost in antiquity, the largest number of species and least specialised forms are found in the Old World, suggesting this family originated there. The taxonomy of the small crakes is complicated, but the closest relative of the corn crake is the African crake, C. <unk>, which has sometimes been given its own genus, <unk>, but is now more usually placed in Crex. Both species are short @-@ billed brown birds with a preference for grassland rather than wetland habitats typical of rails. <unk> crakes, particularly the ash @-@ throated crake ( <unk> <unk> ) are near relatives of the Crex genus. 
<|endoftext|> Corn crakes were first described by Linnaeus in his Systema <unk> in 1758 as <unk> crex, but was subsequently moved to the genus Crex, created by German naturalist and ornithologist Johann <unk> <unk> in 1803, and named Crex <unk>. The earlier use of crex gives it priority over <unk>'s specific name <unk>, and leads to the current name of Crex crex. The binomial name, Crex crex, from the Ancient Greek " <unk> ", is <unk>, referring to the crake's repetitive grating call. The common name
<|endoftext|>> at Memphis and Amun, <unk>, and <unk> at Thebes, were assembled into family <unk>. <unk> connections like these are changeable, in keeping with the multiple perspectives in Egyptian belief. Hathor, as a fertility goddess, could act as mother to any child god, including the child form of the sun god, although in other circumstances she was the sun god's daughter. 
<|endoftext|> Other divine groups were composed of deities with interrelated roles, or who together represented a region of the Egyptian mythological cosmos. There were sets of gods for the hours of the day and night and for each <unk> ( province ) of Egypt. Some of these groups contain a specific, symbolically important number of deities. Paired gods can stand for opposite but interrelated concepts that are part of a greater unity. Ra, who is dynamic and light @-@ producing, and Osiris, who is static and <unk> in darkness, merge into a single god each night. Groups of three are linked with plurality in ancient Egyptian thought, and groups of four <unk> <unk>. Rulers in the late New Kingdom promoted a particularly important group of three gods above all others : Amun, Ra, and Ptah. These deities stood for the plurality of all gods, as well as for their own cult centers ( the major cities of Thebes, <unk>, and Memphis ) and for many threefold sets of concepts in Egyptian religious thought. Sometimes Set, the patron god of the <unk> Dynasty kings and the embodiment of disorder within the world, was added to this group, which emphasized a single coherent vision of the pantheon. 
<|endoftext|> Nine, the product of three and three, represents a multitude, so the Egyptians called several large groups " <unk> ", or sets of nine, even if they had more than nine members. The most prominent <unk> was the <unk> of <unk>, an extended family of deities descended from the creator god Atum, which incorporates many important gods. The term " <unk> " was often extended to include all of Egypt's deities. 
<|endoftext|> This divine assemblage had a vague and changeable hierarchy. Gods with broad influence in the cosmos or who were <unk> older than others had higher positions in divine society. At the apex of this society was the king of the gods, who was usually identified with the creator deity. In different periods of Egyptian history, different gods were most frequently said to hold this exalted position. Horus was the most important god in the Early <unk> Period, Ra rose to <unk> in the Old Kingdom, Amun was supreme in the New, and in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods, Isis was the divine queen and creator goddess. Newly prominent gods tended to adopt characteristics from their predecessors. Isis absorbed the traits of many other goddesses during her rise, and when Amun became the ruler of the pantheon, he was conjoined with Ra, the traditional king of the gods, to become a solar deity.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The gods were believed to manifest in many forms. The Egyptians had complex conception of the human soul, consisting of several parts. The spirits of the gods were composed of many of these same elements. The ba was the component of the human or divine soul that affected the world around it. Any visible manifestation of a god's power could be called its ba ; thus, the sun was called the ba of Ra. A depiction of a deity was considered a <unk>, another component of its being, which acted as a vessel for that deity's ba to inhabit. The cult images of gods that were the focus of temple rituals, as well as the sacred animals that represented certain deities, were believed to house divine bas in this way. Gods could be ascribed many bas and <unk>, which were sometimes given names representing different aspects of the god's nature. Everything in existence was said to be one of the <unk> of Atum the creator god, who originally contained all things within himself, and one deity could be called the ba of another, meaning that the first god is a manifestation of the other's power. Divine body parts could act as separate deities, like the Eye of Ra and Hand of Atum, both of which were personified as goddesses. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> important deities gave rise to local manifestations, which sometimes absorbed the characteristics of older regional gods. Horus had many forms tied to particular places, including Horus of <unk>, Horus of <unk>, and Horus of <unk>. Such local manifestations could be treated almost as separate beings.

The treaty put an end to the fighting between forces supporting Madero and those of Díaz and thus concluded the initial phase of the Mexican Revolution. 
<|endoftext|> The treaty stipulated that Díaz, as well as his vice president Ramón Corral, were to step down by the end of May, and that he was to be replaced by Francisco León de la Barra as interim president and hold presidential elections.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The <unk> aspects of cadmium toxicity have been reviewed. 
<|endoftext|> The most dangerous form of occupational exposure to cadmium is inhalation of fine dust and fumes, or ingestion of highly soluble cadmium compounds. Inhalation of cadmium fumes can result initially in metal <unk> fever but may progress to chemical <unk>, pulmonary <unk>, and death. 
<|endoftext|> Cadmium is also an environmental hazard. Human exposure is primarily from fossil fuel combustion, phosphate fertilizers, natural sources, iron and steel production, cement production and related activities, <unk> metals production, and municipal solid waste <unk>. Bread, root crops, and vegetables also contribute to the cadmium in modern populations. 
<|endoftext|> There have been a few instances of general population poisoning as the result of long @-@ term exposure to cadmium in contaminated food and water, and research into an estrogen mimicry that may induce breast cancer is ongoing. In the decades leading up to World War II, mining operations contaminated the <unk> River in Japan with cadmium and traces of other toxic metals. As a consequence, cadmium accumulated in the rice crops along the riverbanks downstream of the mines. Some members of the local agricultural communities consumed the contaminated rice and developed itai @-@ itai disease and renal abnormalities, including <unk> and <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> The victims of this poisoning were almost exclusively post @-@ <unk> women with low iron and other mineral body stores. Similar general population cadmium exposures in other parts of the world have not resulted in the same health problems because the populations maintained sufficient iron and other mineral levels. Thus, although cadmium is a major factor in the itai @-@ itai disease in Japan, most researchers have concluded that it was one of several factors. Cadmium is one of six substances banned by the European Union's <unk> on <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) directive, which <unk> hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment but allows for certain exemptions and <unk> from the scope of the law. The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified cadmium and cadmium compounds as carcinogenic to humans. Although occupational exposure to cadmium is linked to lung and prostate cancer, there is still a substantial controversy about the <unk> of cadmium in low environmental exposure. Recent data from <unk> studies suggest that intake of cadmium through diet associates to higher risk of <unk>, breast and prostate cancer as well as to <unk> in humans. A recent study has demonstrated that <unk> tissue is characterized by higher levels of cadmium in current and former smoking females. 
<|endoftext|> Cadmium exposure is a risk factor associated with a large number of illnesses including kidney disease, early <unk>, <unk>, and <unk> diseases. Although studies show a significant correlation between cadmium exposure and occurrence of disease in human populations, a necessary molecular mechanism has not been identified. One hypothesis holds that cadmium is an <unk> <unk> and some experimental studies have shown that it can interact with different <unk> signaling pathways. For example, cadmium can bind to the estrogen receptor alpha, and affect signal transduction along the estrogen and <unk> signaling pathways at low doses. 
<|endoftext|> Tobacco smoking is the most important single source of cadmium exposure in the general population. An estimated 10 % of the cadmium content of a cigarette is inhaled through smoking. Absorption of cadmium through the lungs is more effective than through the gut, and as much as 50 % of the cadmium inhaled in cigarette smoke may be absorbed. On average, cadmium concentrations in the blood of smokers is 4 times 5 times greater and in the kidney, 2 – 3 times greater than non @-@ smokers. Despite the high cadmium content in cigarette smoke, there seems to be little exposure to cadmium from passive smoking.

The family lived in the house adjoining the one @-@ room school where Nesbitt was one of 32 pupils taught by Jim ; the other pupils were all farmers'children. Nesbitt grew up " completely " around women, and spent a lot of time alone, " kicking a ball against a wall ". He had ambitions to play football for Manchester United, or to become a teacher like his father. The family was Protestant, and <unk> was in " Paisley country ". The <unk> spent Sunday evenings singing hymns around the piano. Jim marched in the Ballymena Young <unk> flute band and Nesbitt joined him playing the flute. After the <unk> conflicts, they stopped marching with the band.

He continued to act and sing with the Riverside until he was 16, and appeared at festivals and as an extra in Play For Today : The <unk> ( Christopher <unk>, 1984 ). He got his <unk> card when the professional actor playing <unk> Cricket in <unk> broke his ankle two days before the performance, and Nesbitt stepped in to take his place.

Being 18 is the worst age to expect people to learn things. There are other things to be bothered with, like girls and football. " He made the decision to quit when he was trying to write an <unk> essay on <unk> in Les <unk> Sales at 4 am one day. His father suggested that he should move to England if he wanted to continue acting, so Nesbitt enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama ( <unk> ), part of University of London.

In Mozambique, the conflict erupted in 1964 as a result of unrest and frustration amongst many indigenous Mozambican populations, who perceived foreign rule to be a form of exploitation and mistreatment, which served only to further Portuguese economic interests in the region. Many Mozambicans also resented Portugal's policies towards indigenous people, which resulted in discrimination, traditional lifestyle turning difficult for many Africans, and limited access to Portuguese @-@ style education and skilled employment. 
<|endoftext|> As successful self @-@ determination movements spread throughout Africa after World War II, many Mozambicans became progressively nationalistic in outlook, and increasingly frustrated by the nation's continued subservience to foreign rule.

The ethnic Portuguese of the territory, which included most of the ruling authorities, responded with increased military presence and fast @-@ paced development projects. 
<|endoftext|> A mass exile of Mozambique's political intelligentsia to neighbouring countries provided <unk> from which radical Mozambicans could plan actions and foment political unrest in their homeland.

Nonetheless, Mozambique succeeded in achieving independence on June 25, 1975, after a civil resistance movement known as the Carnation Revolution backed by portions of the military in Portugal overthrow the military dictatorship sponsored by US, thus ending 470 years of Portuguese colonial rule in the East African region. According to historians of the Revolution, the military coup in Portugal was in part fuelled by protests concerning the conduct of Portuguese troops in their treatment of some local Mozambican populace. The role of the growing communist influence over the group of Portuguese military insurgents who led the Lisbon's military coup, and, on the other hand, the pressure of the international community over the direction of the Portuguese Colonial War in general, were main causes for the final outcome.

Since David <unk> had returned to the area in 1858 in an attempt to foster trade routes, British interest in Mozambique had risen, <unk> the Portuguese government. During the 19th century, much of Eastern Africa was still being brought under British control, and in order to facilitate this, Britain required several concessions from the Portuguese colony. 
<|endoftext|> As a result, in an attempt to avoid a naval conflict with the superior British Royal Navy, Portugal adjusted the borders of her colony and the modern borders of Mozambique were established in May 1881. Control of Mozambique was left to various organisations such as the Mozambique Company, the <unk> Company and the Niassa Company which were financed and provided with cheap labour by the British Empire to work mines and construct railways. These companies penetrated inland from the coastline, setting up plantations and taxing the local populace who had until then resisted encroachment by the colonists. 
<|endoftext|> The resisting Gaza Empire, a collection of indigenous tribes who inhabited the area that now constitutes Mozambique and Zimbabwe, was defeated in 1895, and the remaining inland tribes were eventually defeated by 1902 ; in that same year, Portugal established Lourenço <unk> as the capital. In 1926, political and economic crisis in Portugal led to the establishment of the Second Republic ( later to become the <unk> Novo ), and a revival of

By 1898, the old growth hemlock was exhausted and the Proctor tannery, then owned by the Elk <unk> Company, was closed and dismantled. <unk> continued in the watershed, but the last logs were floated down Plunketts Creek to the Loyalsock in 1905. The Susquehanna and Eagles Mere Railroad was abandoned in sections between 1922 and 1930, as the lumber it was built to transport was depleted. The <unk> logging railroad and their <unk> sawmills were abandoned in 1930. Without timber, the populations of Proctor and Barbours declined. The Barbours post office closed in the 1930s and the Proctor post office closed on July 1, 1953. Both villages also lost their schools and almost all of their businesses. Proctor celebrated its centennial in 1968, and a 1970 newspaper article on its thirty @-@ ninth annual " Proctor Homecoming " reunion called it a " near @-@ deserted old tannery town ". In the 1980s, the last store in Barbours closed, and the former hotel ( which had become a hunting club ) was torn down to make way for a new bridge across Loyalsock Creek. 
<|endoftext|> Second growth forests have since covered most of the clear @-@ cut land. The beginnings of today's protected areas were established in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries : Pennsylvania's state legislature authorized the acquisition of abandoned clear @-@ cut land in 1897, creating the state forest system. The Game Commission began acquiring property for State Game Lands in 1920, and established the Northcentral State Game Farm on Plunketts Creek in 1945 to raise wild turkey. It was converted to <unk> pheasant production in 1981, and, as of 2007, it is one of four Pennsylvania state game farms producing about 200 @,@ 000 <unk> each year for release on land open to public hunting. The Northcentral State Game Farm is in the Plunketts Creek valley just south of Proctor, and a part of it is on the right bank of Loyalsock Creek downstream of the confluence. The Loyalsock State Game Farm is 13 miles ( 21 km ) downstream on Loyalsock Creek, at the village of <unk>. When a May 2007 fire destroyed a <unk> house there just days before 18 @,@ 000 pheasant chicks were due to hatch, the eggs were transferred to the nearby Northcentral State Game Farm without reduction in the production goal. 
<|endoftext|> As of 2007, Proctor has two separate businesses : a general store ( which also sells gasoline ) and a bed and breakfast. The church which used to host the annual " Proctor Homecoming " <unk> still stands, but is closed. Barbours has no store or gas station, but does have one church. Barbours is home to the Plunketts Creek Township Volunteer Fire Company and township municipal building ( which houses a small branch library ). Since 1967, Barbours has been home to <unk> @-@ <unk>, which makes tranquilizer <unk> and guns for livestock and wildlife capture and control. In 1997, <unk> @-@ <unk> had eight employees. Today much of Plunketts Creek's watershed is wooded and protected as part of Loyalsock State Forest or Pennsylvania State Game Lands No. 134. Pennsylvania's state forests and game lands are managed, and small @-@ scale lumbering operations continue in the watershed today. Barbours has one sawmill, in 1997 it had thirty contract loggers and fifteen employees, with $ 1 @.@ 2 million in annual gross sales. 
<|endoftext|> Plunketts Creek has been a place for lumber and tourism since its villages were founded. Before the advent of automobiles, the area was quite isolated and the 16 mile ( 26 km ) trip to Montoursville took at least three hours ( today it takes less than half an hour ). Residents who used to work locally now commute to Williamsport. " Cabin people " have seasonally increased the population for years, but increasing numbers now live there year round. From 1950 to 2000, the population of Plunketts Creek Township increased 80 @.@ 6 percent from <unk> to <unk> ( for comparison, in the same period Lycoming County's population increased by only 18 @.@ 6 percent, while Sullivan County's declined by 2 @.@ 9 percent ). <unk> still come too : the opening weekend of the trout season brings more people into the village at the mouth of Plunketts Creek than any other time of the year.

<|endoftext|> The English mycologist John <unk> reported that Amanita muscaria was used for getting rid of bugs in England and Sweden, and bug agaric was an old alternate name for the species. French mycologist Pierre <unk> reported having tried without success to replicate its fly @-@ killing properties in his work <unk> des <unk> <unk> et <unk> de la France ( 1784 ), and proposed a new binomial name Agaricus pseudo @-@ <unk> because of this. One compound isolated from the fungus is 1 @,@ 3 @-@ <unk> ( 1 @,@ 3 @-@ Di ( <unk> @-@ 9 @-@ <unk> ) <unk> ), which attracts insects. It has been <unk> that the flies intentionally seek out the fly agaric for its <unk> properties. An alternative derivation proposes that the term <unk> refers not to insects as such but rather the <unk> resulting from consumption of the fungus. This is based on the medieval belief that flies could enter a person's head and cause mental illness. Several regional names appear to be linked with this <unk>, meaning the " mad " or " fool's " version of the highly regarded edible mushroom Amanita caesarea. Hence there is <unk> <unk> " mad <unk> " in Catalan, <unk> <unk> from Toulouse, <unk> <unk> from the <unk> department in Southern France, <unk> <unk> from <unk> in Italy. A local dialect name in <unk> in Switzerland is <unk> de <unk>, which translates as " Devil's hat ". 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Classification = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Amanita muscaria is the type species of the genus. By extension, it is also the type species of Amanita subgenus Amanita, as well as section Amanita within this subgenus. Amanita subgenus Amanita includes all Amanita with <unk> spores. Amanita section Amanita includes the species which have very <unk> universal veil remnants, including a volva that is reduced to a series of concentric rings and the veil remnants on the cap to a series of patches or warts. Most species in this group also have a bulbous base. Amanita section Amanita consists of A. muscaria and its close relatives, including A. <unk> ( the panther cap ), A. <unk>, A. <unk>, and A. <unk>. Modern fungal <unk> have classified Amanita muscaria and its allies this way based on gross morphology and spore <unk>. Two recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed this classification as natural. 
<|endoftext|> Amanita muscaria varies considerably in its morphology, and many authorities recognise several subspecies or varieties within the species. In The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy, German mycologist Rolf Singer listed three subspecies, though without description : A. muscaria ssp. muscaria, A. muscaria ssp. <unk>, and A. muscaria ssp. flavivolvata. 
<|endoftext|> Contemporary authorities recognise up to seven varieties : 
<|endoftext|> A 2006 molecular phylogenetic study of different regional populations of A. muscaria by mycologist <unk> <unk> and colleagues found three distinct clades within this species representing, roughly, Eurasian, Eurasian " subalpine ", and North American populations. Specimens belonging to all three clades have been found in Alaska ; this has led to the hypothesis that this was the centre of <unk> for this species. The study also looked at four named varieties of the species : var. <unk>, var. flavivolvata, var. <unk> ( including var. <unk> ), and var. regalis from both areas. All four varieties were found within both the Eurasian and North American clades, evidence that these morphological forms are <unk> rather than distinct subspecies or varieties. Further molecular study by <unk> and colleagues published in 2008 show that these three genetic groups, plus a fourth associated with oak – <unk> – pine forest in the southeastern United States and two more on Santa Cruz Island in California, are delineated from each other enough genetically to be considered separate species ; thus A. muscaria as it stands currently is evidently a species complex. The complex also includes at least three other closely related taxa that are currently regarded as species : A. <unk> is a buff @-@ capped mushroom associated with conifers from the Pacific Northwest, and the brown @-@ capped A. <unk> and A. <unk>

Their elder children were <unk> ( 1901 – 89 ) and Gerard <unk> " <unk> " ( 1904 – 58 ). His great @-@ great @-@ grandfather was of French Huguenot descent, and Olivier came from a long line of Protestant clergymen. Gerard Olivier had begun a career as a schoolmaster, but in his thirties he discovered a strong religious <unk> and was ordained as a priest of the Church of England. He practised extremely high church, <unk> Christianity and liked to be addressed as " Father Olivier ". This made him unacceptable to most Anglican congregations, and the only church posts he was offered were temporary, usually <unk> for regular <unk> in their absence. This meant a nomadic existence, and for Laurence's first few years, he never lived in one place long enough to make friends. 
<|endoftext|> In 1912, when Olivier was five, his father secured a permanent appointment as assistant priest at St <unk>'s, <unk>. He held the post for six years, and a stable family life was at last possible. Olivier was devoted to his mother, but not to his father, whom he found a cold and remote parent. Nevertheless, he learned a great deal of the art of performing from him. As a young man Gerard Olivier had considered a stage career and was a dramatic and effective preacher. Olivier wrote that his father knew " when to drop the voice, when to <unk> about the <unk> of <unk>, when to slip in a gag, when suddenly to wax sentimental... The quick changes of mood and manner absorbed me, and I have never forgotten them. " 
<|endoftext|> In 1916, after attending a series of preparatory schools, Olivier passed the singing examination for admission to the choir school of All Saints, Margaret Street, in central London. His elder brother was already a pupil, and
<|endoftext|> 1840s and 1850s witnessed large @-@ scale immigration from the Eastern U.S. and Europe. By 1860 approximately 80 % percent of Minnesota's <unk> population came from New York and New England. The state was in fact for a time known as the " New England of the West ". Maine, in particular, contributed a large number of immigrants, probably because of the large number of <unk> in Maine and the growing lumber industry in Minnesota. 
<|endoftext|> By the 1850s racist ideology, which was becoming prevalent in much of the U.S., began to affect Minnesota more significantly than it had in the past. The ruling class was composed of primarily Anglo @-@ American Protestants. Settlers from the U.S. increasingly discussed " white " inhabitants as the key to Minnesota's future with an eye toward <unk> the role that other " inferior " races would have in the future. Author James Wesley Bond in 1853 described Minnesota before the 1850s as " a waste of woodland and prairie, uninhabited save by the different hordes of savage tribes from time immemorial. " <unk> in the territory, however, were complicated. As late as 1840 <unk> in Saint Paul were commonly treated as equals to others in the community with children of all races attending the same schools. By the late 1840s, however, all blacks had been completely disenfranchised. In addition they were prevented from running for office and their children were segregated in schools. By contrast Irish Catholics and Native Americans who adopted European lifestyles were allowed to vote and their children were not segregated in the classrooms. <unk> whereas Anglo @-@ Americans generally accepted business development by African Americans, they largely opposed business development by Irish immigrants. 
<|endoftext|> Minnesota was a multi @-@ lingual area throughout the era. During the earlier parts of the era French and English were widely used but Ojibwe, Sioux, and <unk> ( the language of the Métis ) were more widespread. By the late 1850s English had grown to be the most spoken language. New immigrants, though, brought additional languages to the territory. Newspapers were published in German ( Die Minnesota Deutsche Zeitung ), Swedish ( Minnesota <unk> ), and Norwegian ( <unk> <unk> ). Irish Gaelic, Czech and other languages were used in various communities as well. 
<|endoftext|> Most of the population of the region in earlier decades followed traditional tribal religious practices. However, Roman Catholicism had been known in the area long before its acquisition by the U.S. because of the many French traders who lived and <unk> there. Catholic missionary activity among the Métis expanded greatly in the early 19th century with the Catholic Church becoming particularly established in Saint Paul. <unk> was rather a much newer phenomenon though some Protestant missionaries had entered the region in the early 19th century as well.

<|endoftext|> There shall be neither slavery nor <unk> servitude in the said territory, otherwise than in the punishment of crime, <unk> the party shall have been duly convicted. 
<|endoftext|> The ordinance was nevertheless seen as ambiguous in that it did not specifically address the slaves already in the territories, and it discussed the " free " population of the territories seemingly implying that a slave population would exist. French traders in the territories, and later even American army officers ( including Josiah Snelling who commanded his namesake fort ), continued to hold slaves with the blessings of many in Congress. 
<|endoftext|> The number of African Americans in the territory during this period was quite small but not insignificant. <unk> continued to bring slaves with them, but there were many free blacks as well, some working as servants and some as completely independent pioneers. Information about the black immigrants during the earlier periods is sparse, but records do show that most of those at Fort Snelling were slaves. Records from 1850 indicate a population of 39 free blacks out of a total population of 6 @,@ 077 citizens in the territory ( which excluded Native American tribes ). Before the 1840s these free persons could often expect to be treated equal to other racial groups. By the time Minnesota had achieved statehood, however, blacks had been disenfranchised and schools were segregated. Despite this, from the start of the Minnesota Territory in 1848 the leadership was predominantly <unk> thus ending the practice in this era.

<|endoftext|> A native of Texas, Applewhite attended several universities and, as a young man, served in the United States Army. After finishing school at Austin College, he taught music at the University of Alabama. He later returned to Texas, where he led choruses and served as the chair of the music department at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. He left the school in 1970, citing emotional turmoil. His father's death a year later brought on severe depression. In 1972, he developed a close friendship with Bonnie Nettles, a nurse ; together, they discussed mysticism at length and concluded that they were called as divine messengers. They operated a bookstore and teaching center for a short while, and then began to travel around the U.S. in 1973 to spread their views. They only gained one convert. In 1975, Applewhite was arrested for failing to return a rental car and was jailed for six months. In jail, he further developed his theology. 
<|endoftext|> After Applewhite's release, he traveled to California and Oregon with Nettles, eventually gaining a group of committed followers. Applewhite and Nettles told their followers that they would be visited by extraterrestrials who would provide them with new bodies. Applewhite initially stated that he and his followers would physically ascend to a spaceship, where their bodies would be transformed, but later, he came to believe that their bodies were the mere containers of their souls, which would later be placed into new bodies. These ideas were expressed with language drawn from Christian <unk>, the New Age movement, and American popular culture.

<|endoftext|> Barker continued to attend evening classes at the Croydon Art School between the 1920s and the 1940s, eventually receiving a teaching position. She took <unk> trips to <unk> and Storrington in Sussex and to Cornwall and the southern coast with family and friends.

<|endoftext|> The seeds of modern AI were planted by classical philosophers who attempted to describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in the invention of the programmable digital computer in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain. 
<|endoftext|> The Turing test was proposed by British mathematician Alan Turing in his 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which opens with the words : " I propose to consider the question,'Can machines think?'"

<|endoftext|> The album received largely favorable reviews, although several critics described it as a minor addition to Dylan's canon of work. Andy Gill wrote in The Independent that the record " features Dylan in fairly relaxed, spontaneous mood, content to grab such grooves and sentiments as <unk> momentarily across his radar. So while it may not contain too many landmark tracks, it's one of the most naturally enjoyable albums you 'll hear all year. " 
<|endoftext|> In its first week of release, the album reached number one in the Billboard 200 chart in the U.S., making Bob Dylan ( 67 years of age ) the oldest artist to ever debut at number one on that chart. It also reached number one on the UK album chart, 39 years after Dylan's previous UK album chart <unk> New Morning. This meant that Dylan currently holds the record for the longest gap between solo number one albums in the UK chart.

<|endoftext|> The album received generally favorable reviews.

This particular project became intrinsically linked with Portugal's concerns over security in the overseas colonies. The Portuguese government viewed the construction of the dam as testimony to Portugal's " <unk> mission " and intended for the dam to <unk> Mozambican belief in the strength and security of the Portuguese colonial government. To this end, Portugal sent three thousand new troops and over one million landmines to Mozambique to defend the building project. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> the symbolic significance of the dam to the Portuguese, FRELIMO proceeded to spend seven years attempting to halt its construction by force. No direct attacks were ever successful, but FRELIMO had some success in attacking convoys en route to the site. FRELIMO also lodged a protest with the United Nations about the project, and their cause was aided by negative reports of Portuguese actions in Mozambique. In spite of the subsequent withdrawal of much foreign financial support for the dam, it was finally completed in December 1974. The dam's intended propaganda value to the Portuguese was overshadowed by the adverse Mozambican public reaction to the extensive dispersal of the indigenous populace, who were forced to relocate from their homes to allow for the construction project. The dam also deprived farmers of the critical annual floods, which formerly re @-@ fertilised the plantations.

Many sources state that, in an attempt to rectify the situation in Mozambique, the Portuguese secret police assassinated Mondlane by sending a parcel to his office in Dar es Salaam. Inside the parcel was a book containing an explosive device, which detonated upon opening. Other sources state that Eduardo was killed when an explosive device detonated underneath his chair at the FRELIMO headquarters, and that the faction responsible was never identified.

<|endoftext|> Although the exact details of the assassination remain disputed, the involvement of the Portuguese government, particularly <unk> Press or PIDE, is generally accepted by most historians and biographers and is supported by the Portuguese stay behind <unk> @-@ esque army, known as <unk> Press, that suggested in 1990 that they were responsible for the assassination. Initially, due to the uncertainty regarding who was responsible, Mondlane's death created great suspicion within the ranks of the FRELIMO itself and a short power struggle which resulted in a dramatic swing to the political left. 
<|endoftext|> Mondlane's immediate successor was the moderate Rev. <unk> Simango, who had served under him, as FRELIMO's vice @-@ President, from its formation until 1969.

In January 1940 Olivier and Esmond were granted their divorce. In February, following another request from Leigh, her husband also applied for their marriage to be terminated. 
<|endoftext|> On stage, Olivier and Leigh starred in Romeo and Juliet on Broadway. It was an extravagant production, but a commercial failure. In The New York Times Brooks Atkinson praised the scenery but not the acting : " Although Miss Leigh and Mr Olivier are handsome young people they hardly act their parts at all. " The couple had invested almost all their savings in the project, and its failure was a grave financial blow. They were married in August 1940, at the San <unk> Ranch in Santa Barbara. 
<|endoftext|> The war in Europe had been under way for a year and was going badly for Britain. After his wedding Olivier wanted to help the war effort. He telephoned Duff Cooper, the Minister of Information under Winston Churchill, hoping to get a position in Cooper's department. Cooper advised him to remain where he was and speak to the film director Alexander Korda, who was based in the US at Churchill's behest, with connections to British Intelligence. Korda — with Churchill's support and involvement — directed That Hamilton Woman, with Olivier as <unk> Nelson and Leigh in the title role. Korda saw that the relationship between the couple was strained. Olivier was tiring of Leigh's <unk> <unk>, and she was drinking to excess. The film, in which the threat of Napoleon paralleled that of Hitler, was seen by critics as " bad history but good British propaganda ", according to the BFI. 
<|endoftext|> Olivier's life was under threat from the Nazis and pro @-@ German <unk>. The studio owners were concerned enough that Samuel Goldwyn and Cecil B. <unk> both provided support and security to ensure his safety. On the completion of filming, Olivier and Leigh returned to Britain. He had spent the previous year learning to fly and had completed nearly 250 hours by the time he left America. He intended to join the Royal Air Force but instead made another propaganda film, 49th <unk>, narrated short pieces for the Ministry of Information, and joined the Fleet Air Arm because Richardson was already in the service. Richardson had gained a reputation for crashing aircraft, which Olivier rapidly eclipsed. Olivier and Leigh settled in a cottage just outside RAF <unk> Down, where he was stationed with a training squadron ; Noël Coward visited the couple and thought Olivier looked unhappy. Olivier spent much of his time taking part in broadcasts and making speeches to build morale, and in 1942 he was invited to make another propaganda film, The <unk> @-@ Paradise, in which he played a Soviet engineer who helps improve British @-@ Russian relationships. 
<|endoftext|> In 1943, at the behest of the Ministry of Information, Olivier began working on Henry V. Originally he had no intention of taking the directorial duties, but ended up directing and producing, in addition to taking the title role. He was assisted by an Italian <unk>, Filippo Del <unk>, who had been released to produce propaganda for the Allied cause. The decision was made to film the battle scenes in neutral <unk>, where it was easier to find the 650 extras. John Betjeman, the press <unk> at the British embassy in Dublin, played a key liaison role with the Irish government in making suitable arrangements. The film was released in November 1944. Brooke, writing for the BFI, considers that it " came too late in the Second World War to be a call to arms as such, but formed a powerful reminder of what Britain was defending. " The music for the film was written by William Walton, " a score that ranks with the best in film music ", according to the music critic Michael Kennedy. Walton also provided the music for Olivier's next two Shakespearean adaptations, Hamlet ( 1948 ) and Richard III ( 1955 ). Henry V was warmly received by critics. The reviewer for The Manchester Guardian wrote that the film combined " new art hand @-@ in @-@ hand with old genius, and both superbly of one mind ", in a film that worked " <unk> ". The critic for The Times considered that Olivier " plays Henry on a high, heroic note and never is there danger of a crack ", in a film described as " a triumph of film craft ". There were Oscar nominations for the film, including Best Picture and Best Actor, but it won none and Olivier was instead presented with a " Special Award ".

On January 28, then Governor Henry Massey Rector informed Captain Totten that he and his soldiers would be " permitted to remain in the possession of the Federal officers until the State, by authority of the people, shall have determined to <unk> their connection with the General Government, " Totten responded to this by telling the Governor that his orders came from the United States Government and began a desperate but ultimately futile dispatch of letters and <unk> asking for reinforcements, although rumors were widely spread that they were already coming. The first telegraph wire to span between Little Rock and Memphis had recently been completed. Local attorney John M Harrel was asked to compose the first telegraph dispatched from Arkansas's capital. In his message, Harrel reported unconfirmed rumors that more federal troops had been sent to reinforce the Little Rock Arsenal. 
<|endoftext|> The United States troops at the outposts of the western frontier of the state and in the Indian nation have all been recalled from winter quarters to reinforce the garrison at Fort Smith.

By February 5, six militia units, consisting of 1 @,@ 000 men, with a guarantee that the numbers could be increased to 5 @,@ 000 if the situations deemed it necessary, had assembled in Little Rock. Governor Rector vehemently denied ordering the troops to assemble or giving any order at all in connection with the troops. Faced with the fact that the military had assembled believing they were following his orders and the consensus of the citizens of Little Rock against any armed conflict between the civilian army and federal troops, Governor Rector was forced to take control of the situation. On February 6, he sent a formal demand for surrender of the arsenal to Captain Totten, 
<|endoftext|> This movement is prompted by the feeling that <unk> the citizens of this State that in the present emergency the arms and munitions of war in the Arsenal should be under the control of the State authorities, in order to their security. This movement, although not authorized by me, has assumed such an aspect that it becomes my duty, as the executive of this <unk>, to <unk> my official authority to prevent a collision between the people of the State and the Federal troops under your command. I therefore demand in the name of the State the delivery of the possession of the Arsenal and munitions of war under your charge to the State authorities, to be held subject to the action of the convention to be held on the 4th of March next. 
<|endoftext|> Perhaps because Abraham Lincoln had not yet been inaugurated as President, Captain Totten received no instructions from his superiors and was forced to withdraw his troops. He agreed to surrender the arsenal as long as the governor agreed to three provisions : 
<|endoftext|> The governor would take possession of the arsenal in the name of the United States. 
<|endoftext|> The soldiers would be allowed safe passage in any direction carrying any personal and public property besides munitions of war. 
<|endoftext|> The soldiers would be allowed to march away as men leaving under orders, not as conquered and surrendering soldiers. 
<|endoftext|> On the morning of February 8, 1861, Rector and Totten signed an agreement placing the arsenal in the hands of state officials. That afternoon, the citizen militia marched to the arsenal with Governor Rector at its head. All of the federal troops had left at this point, except Totten who had stayed behind to listen to the Governor's speech and to hand the arsenal over in person. 
<|endoftext|> The Little Rock Arsenal was classified in 1860 as an " arsenal of deposit, " meaning that it was simply a warehouse for the storage of weapons intended for the use of the state militia in times of crisis. Thus there were no substantial operations for ordnance fabrication or repairs, nor for the manufacture of cartridges at the time the Arsenal fell into State hands. Most of these operations were started from scratch through the efforts of the Arkansas Military Board.

Bertin's final pose reverses the usual relationship between the two men.

He wears a gold watch and a pair of glasses in his right pocket. In the view of art historian Robert Rosenblum, his " nearly ferocious presence " is <unk> by the tightly constrained space. The chair and clothes appear too small to contain him. His coiled, <unk> fingers rest on his thighs, barely protruding from the sleeves of his jacket, while his neck cannot be seen above his narrow <unk> white collar. 
<|endoftext|> The painting is composed in monochrome, muted colours ; predominately blacks, greys and <unk>. The exceptions are the whites of his collar and sleeves, the reds in the cushion and the light reflecting on the leather of the arm @-@ chair. In 19th @-@ century art, vivid colour was associated with femininity and emotion ; male portraiture tended towards muted shades and monochrome.

Jacques @-@ Louis David also explored hyper @-@ realism in his depictions of Cooper <unk> ( 1802 ) and Emmanuel Joseph <unk> ( 1817 ).

The wall is painted in gold, adding to the sense of a monumental portrait of a modern icon. The details of Bertin's face are highly symmetrical.

This dual expression is intended to show his <unk> and complex personality : he is a hard @-@ <unk> businessman, and a patron of the arts. The reflection of a window can be seen in the rim of Bertin's chair. It is barely discernible, but adds spatial depth.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Hydnellum peckii is a mycorrhizal fungus, and as such establishes a mutualistic relationship with the roots of certain trees ( referred to as " hosts " ), in which the fungus exchanges minerals and amino acids extracted from the soil for fixed carbon from the host. The subterranean hyphae of the fungus grow a sheath of tissue around the rootlets of a broad range of tree species, in an intimate association that is especially beneficial to the host ( termed ectomycorrhizal ), as the fungus produces enzymes that <unk> organic compounds and facilitate the transfer of nutrients to the tree. 
<|endoftext|> The ectomycorrhizal structures of H. peckii are among a few in the Bankeraceae that have been studied in detail. They are characterized by a <unk> mantle — a layer of tissue made of hyphae tightly arranged in a parallel orientation, or palisade, and which rarely branch or overlap each other. These hyphae, along with adhering mineral soil particles, are embedded in a gelatinous matrix. The hyphae of the ectomycorrhizae can become <unk>, an adaptation that helps the fungus tolerate unfavorable conditions. <unk> of H. peckii have a peculiar structure — markedly distinct from those of other Bankeraceae — with thick, smooth inner walls and an outer wall that is split <unk> into warts. The most striking characteristic of the ectomycorrhizae as a whole is the way the black outer layers of older sections are shed, giving a " <unk> appearance ". The majority of the underground <unk> of the fungus is concentrated near the surface, most likely as " mycelial mats " — dense clusters of ectomycorrhizae and mycelium. The mycelium is also known to extend far beyond the site of the fruit bodies, as far as 337 centimeters ( 11 @.@ 1 ft ) away. 
<|endoftext|> Molecular techniques have been developed to help with conservation efforts of <unk> hydnoid fungi, including H. peckii. While the distribution of the fungus has traditionally been determined by counting the fruit bodies, this method has a major drawback in that fruit bodies are not produced consistently every year, and the absence of fruit bodies is not an indication of the absence of its mycelium in the soil. More modern techniques using the polymerase chain reaction to assess the presence of the fungal DNA in the soil have helped alleviate the issues in monitoring the presence and distribution of fungi mycelia.

The artwork and lyrics explore the history, culture, art, and geography of the state — Stevens developed them after <unk> criminal, literary, and historical documents. Following a July 4, 2005 release date, Stevens promoted Illinois with a world tour. 
<|endoftext|> Critics praised the album for its well @-@ written lyrics and complex orchestrations ; in particular, reviewers noted Stevens'progress as a songwriter since the release of Michigan. Illinois was named the best @-@ reviewed album of 2005 by review aggregator Metacritic, and was included on several reviewers'" best of the decade " lists — including those of Paste, NPR, and Rolling Stone. The album amounted to Stevens'greatest public success to date : it was his first to place on the Billboard 200, and it topped the Billboard list of " Heatseekers Albums ". The varied instrumentation and experimental songwriting on the album invoked comparisons to work by Steve Reich, Neil Young, and The Cure. Besides numerous references to Illinois history, geography, and attractions, Stevens continued a theme of his songwriting career by including multiple references to his Christian faith.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Stevens launched his 50 @-@ state project in 2003 with the album Michigan and chose to focus on Illinois with this recording because " it wasn 't a great leap ", and he liked the state because he considered it the " center of gravity " for the American Midwest. Before creating the album, Stevens read literature by Illinois authors Saul <unk> and Carl <unk>, and studied immigration records and history books for the state — he made the deliberate decision to avoid current events and focused on historical themes. He also took trips through several locations in Illinois and asked friends and members of Internet chat rooms for anecdotes about their experiences in the state. Although he began work in 2004 on Oregon @-@ themed songs and briefly considered releasing a Rhode Island 7 ", Stevens has since not released another album focused on a state, saying in a November 2009 interview with Paste that " the whole premise was such a joke, " and telling Andrew Purcell of The Guardian in October 2009 " I have no qualms about admitting [ the fifty states project ] was a promotional gimmick. " An Arkansas @-@ related song was released through NPR as " The Lord God Bird " and material intended for New Jersey and New York became The <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> All of the songs on Illinois were written, recorded, engineered, and produced by Stevens, with most of the material being recorded at The <unk> Project studio in Astoria, Queens, and in Stevens'Brooklyn apartment. As with his previous albums, Stevens recorded in various locations, with additional piano recorded in St. Paul's Church in Brooklyn ; strings and vocals performed in collaborators'apartments ; electronic organ recorded in the New Jerusalem Recreational Room in <unk>, New Jersey ; and <unk> played at Carroll Music Studios in New York City. Stevens mostly created the album without collaboration, focusing on the writing, performance, and technical creation of the album by himself : " I was pretty <unk> in the construction of Illinois. I spent a lot of time alone, a few months in isolation working on my own and in the studio. I let things germinate and <unk> independently, without thinking about an audience or a live show at all.

<|endoftext|> = = Waterway usage fees = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Bedell sponsored several bold initiatives during his tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents'problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 that would require the barge industry to pay a fee for using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate. 
<|endoftext|> Congress eventually passed a watered @-@ down version of the original plan put forward by Bedell and Senator Pete Domenici. The compromise version enacted a tax on the gasoline barges used and put it into a " trust " for waterway projects. While other supporters of waterway usage fees, including Domenici, backed the compromise, Bedell gave a <unk> plea for his colleagues to oppose it. He viewed it as lacking a crucial element of the original plan - that of capital recovery. The trust was optional, and the Government could spend money on waterway projects irrespective of the trust. The compromise was eventually signed by Jimmy Carter. Bedell's original plan never made it through the House of Representatives, but he continued to introduce it in succeeding sessions. It would not, however, get a floor vote in succeeding sessions. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = <unk> issues = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In 1985, Bedell put forward an agricultural plan that he thought would increase production controls for farmers, thus raising prices for crops. This plan, backed by labor unions and certain Democrats, passed the Agriculture Committee as an amendment to farm legislation. It mandated a referendum that would then be used to determine what types of production controls to enact. The purpose of this plan was <unk> : production controls would decrease the aggregate supply of crops, thus making individual crops cost more ( which would benefit farmers, who were in the middle of an acute debt crisis. ) Second, by styling it as a referendum, the farmers would get to decide the severity of the controls. 
<|endoftext|> On the other hand, opponents of the Bedell plan had a very different view of this legislation. Representatives such as Pat Roberts claimed that the referendum was redundant because the farmers already voted the politicians into office, and this bill was an example of the politicians not doing their jobs. The Reagan Administration opposed the bill because of their opposition to production controls, and the President threatened to veto the farm bill if Bedell's plan was left in place. When the bill got to the floor, an amendment was proposed to strike this provision, and it was passed 251 @-@ 174.

<|endoftext|> In these investigations, Bedell quickly gained the support of small gasoline <unk> and Congressman Bill Nelson. The chief target, <unk>, was accused of not paying all of its taxes on <unk> crude oil. In the end, the government tried to make a case against <unk>, but it was eventually dropped in 1985.

During the trip, Bedell spoke with soldiers, generals, governmental officials and members of the contras. His conclusion at the end of the trip was that Ronald Reagan was aiding the contras in violation of federal law. He promised to hold hearings after returning to Congress. Bedell would later join other House Democrats in demanding documents from the White House related to the contras, but the Reagan Administration refused to provide them. Bedell became <unk> with the Reagan Administration as the decade wore on. He called his Central American policies " sheer <unk>, " saying that the mining of <unk> was an acts of war.

She thought that the change in Soval's opinions in this episode was difficult to accept and that the other members of the main cast didn 't get a great deal to do in the episode. However, whilst she thought that " Awakening " was a visual improvement over " The Forge ", she was reserving judgement until she had seen the third part of the trilogy.

It was transferred to the Order of the Knights Templar by Henry II in 1189. It survived the Great Fire in 1666, but was declared unsafe and rebuilt by Christopher Wren in 1679.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Tessa, and Kirsch's character Richie, were designed as MacLeod's mortal companions and contacts. Tessa and MacLeod are lovers and share deep feelings for each other. Adrian Paul commented that MacLeod spent twelve years with Tessa without wanting another relationship and that "... she was a very important part of his life ". Vandernoot thought that "... the relationship between Tessa and MacLeod was very deep because very soon, he told her about himself (... ) because he trusted her, and I think trust is a very good definition of their relationship. She trusted him entirely and he trusted her. " Tessa is thus MacLeod's only mortal lover who knows of his immortality. 
<|endoftext|> However, executive producer Bill Panzer was intrigued by the idea that a mortal would want to spend their life with an Immortal, this choice having several drawbacks. MacLeod does not age, while Tessa is mortal and will age. Despite their mutual wish, they know growing old together is impossible and this uneasy thought "... haunts them both, sometimes more than others. " As an Immortal, MacLeod is also sterile and Tessa <unk> herself to having no children. " The Sea Witch " deals with Tessa's choice and its impact upon her life. In this episode, Tessa becomes very fond of a four @-@ year @-@ old girl and muses ; " For a while there, just for a few hours... I felt like she was mine. I liked how it felt. But, she's not... I have my own life and it's more than enough. " Panzer commented that " The Sea Witch " "... brings forth in a very powerful way what exactly [ Tessa ]'s giving up to be with MacLeod. " 
<|endoftext|> Tessa occasionally meets MacLeod's previous Immortal lovers. In " The Lady and the Tiger ", she immediately dislikes Amanda ( played by Elizabeth <unk> ) and the script notes that "... sparks fly between the two women ". Although she quickly earns Amanda's respect, Tessa feels like she has to compete with Amanda, while Amanda comments that Tessa is "... quite refreshing in a <unk> sort of way. " <unk> played Amanda's interaction with Tessa <unk> and a little <unk>. Tessa is usually jealous of MacLeod's past lovers, but acknowledges in " Saving Grace " that "... it would take me several lifetimes to find out everything in Duncan's past. I know there've been others, but I never thought I would meet one of them. " 
<|endoftext|> In addition, Tessa shares with MacLeod the consequences of his involvement in the Game. She dislikes the Game and would like to escape from it with him, since she fears for his life. According to Vandernoot, Tessa "... always thought that she [ would ] die before [ MacLeod ] ", but when he told her about the Game during " The Gathering ", " she [ realised ] that he [ could ] be killed ", thus she avoided thinking about it. Another consequence of the Game is that Tessa is sometimes exposed to danger from Immortals who want to use her to pressure MacLeod. Despite being captured by Quince in " The Gathering ", by the time of " Band of Brothers ", she is able to face Grayson : " If you think [ MacLeod ] will stand by,... you have <unk> him terribly. So you 'd better kill me, now, and be done with it. " Grayson releases her and calls her "... a remarkable woman, well worth keeping alive. " Consequently, Tessa is fully aware of the risks of their relationship, but stays with MacLeod, explaining in " Eyewitness " that " I know the risks I choose to take... I stay with you because I want to. I won 't run. I'm not the little woman and I 'll never be barefoot and pregnant. We all have things to face. This is mine. " However, she finds difficult to deal with her fears when MacLeod leaves to fight another Immortal.

However, hundreds of crusaders soon returned to Europe because of a famine following the previous year's poor harvest.

Although military action was suspended after their departure, the crusaders restored fortifications at Caesarea and Atlit. After new troops arrived from the Holy Roman Empire in April, they decided to invade Egypt. They elected John supreme commander, giving him the right to rule the land they would conquer.

The crusaders built a floating fortress on the Nile near Damietta, but a storm blew it near the Egyptian camp. The Egyptians seized the fortress, killing nearly all of its defenders. Only two soldiers survived the attack ; they were accused of cowardice, and John ordered their execution. Taking advantage of the new Italian troops, Cardinal Pelagius began to intervene in strategic decisions. His debates with John angered their troops. The soldiers broke into the Egyptian camp on 29 August 1219 without an order, but they were soon defeated and nearly annihilated.

Together with Scribe, Meyerbeer reviewed many subjects before deciding, in 1832, on Les Huguenots.

Les Huguenots was the first opera to be performed at the Opéra more than 1 @,@ 000 times ( the 1,000th performance being on 16 May 1906 ) and continued to be produced up to 1936, more than a century after its premiere.

Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who ( as he wrote to a friend )'years ago... <unk> to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work, and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal <unk> ', refused to be drawn on any of these matters.

Busch insisted on first making the drawings, afterwards writing the verse. Surviving preparatory drawings show line notes, ideas, and movement and <unk> studies. The draft was then transferred by pencil on white @-@ <unk> panels of hardwood end grain. Not only was it hard work, but the quality of the printing block was crucial. Everything left white on the block, around Busch's drawn lines, was cut from the plate by skilled <unk>. Wood engraving allows a finer differentiation than woodcut and the potential tonal values are of almost the quality of intaglio printing, such as copper engraving. Sometimes the result was not satisfactory, leading Busch to rework or reproduce plates. The wood engraving technique did not allow for fine lines, which is why Busch's drawing, especially in his illustrated tales up to the mid @-@ 1870s, are boldly drawn, giving his work its particular characteristic.

<|endoftext|> Olivier gradually settled in, though he felt himself to be something of an <unk>. The church's style of worship was ( and remains ) Anglo @-@ Catholic, with emphasis on ritual, vestments and incense. The theatricality of the services appealed to Olivier, and the vicar encouraged the students to develop a taste for secular as well as religious drama. In a school production of Julius Caesar in 1917, the ten @-@ year @-@ old Olivier's performance as Brutus impressed an audience that included Lady Tree, the young Sybil Thorndike, and Ellen Terry, who wrote in her diary, " The small boy who played Brutus is already a great actor. " He later won praise in other schoolboy productions, as Maria in Twelfth Night ( 1918 ) and Katherine in The <unk> of the <unk> ( 1922 ). 
<|endoftext|> From All Saints, Olivier went on to St Edward's School, Oxford, from 1920 to 1924. He made little mark until his final year, when he played Puck in the school's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream ; his performance was a tour de force that won him popularity among his fellow pupils. In January 1924, his brother left England to work in India as a rubber <unk>. Olivier missed him greatly and asked his father how soon he could follow. He recalled in his memoirs that his father replied, " Don 't be such a fool, you're not going to India, you're going on the stage. "

Olivier's sister had been a student there and was a favourite of <unk> Fogerty, the founder and principal of the school. Olivier later speculated that it was on the strength of this that Fogerty agreed to award him the <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> One of Olivier's contemporaries at the school was Peggy Ashcroft, who observed he was " rather <unk> in that his sleeves were too short and his hair stood on end but he was intensely lively and great fun ". By his own admission, he was not a very conscientious student, but Fogerty liked him and later said that he and Ashcroft stood out among her many pupils. On leaving the school after a year, Olivier gained work with small touring companies before being taken on in 1925 by Sybil Thorndike and her husband, Lewis <unk>, as a bit @-@ part player, <unk> and assistant stage manager for their London company. He modelled his performing style on that of Gerald du <unk>, of whom he said, " He seemed to <unk> on stage but had such perfect technique. When I started I was so busy doing a du <unk> that no one ever heard a word I said. The Shakespearean actors one saw were terrible <unk> like Frank Benson. " His concern to speak naturally and avoid what he called " singing " Shakespeare's verse was the cause of much frustration in his early career, with critics regularly decrying his delivery. 
<|endoftext|> In 1926, on Thorndike's recommendation, Olivier joined the Birmingham Repertory Company. His biographer Michael Billington describes the Birmingham company as " Olivier's university ", where in his second year he was given the chance to play a wide range of important roles, including Tony <unk> in She <unk> to <unk>, the title role in Uncle Vanya, and <unk> in All's Well That <unk> Well. Billington adds that the engagement led to " a lifelong friendship with his fellow actor Ralph Richardson that was to have a decisive effect on the British theatre. " 
<|endoftext|> While playing the juvenile lead in Bird in Hand at the <unk> Theatre in June 1928, Olivier began a relationship with Jill Esmond, the daughter of the actors Henry V. Esmond and Eva Moore. Olivier later recounted that he thought " she would most certainly do excellent well for a wife... I wasn 't likely to do any better at my age and with my undistinguished track @-@ record, so I promptly fell in love with her. " 
<|endoftext|> In 1928 Olivier created the role of <unk> in R. C. <unk>'s Journey's End, in which he scored a great success at its single Sunday night premiere.

" You Got Me " features rap verses from Jay @-@ Z and Freeway, was noted by Carey as a " signature Just Blaze track ". Jay @-@ Z was in Capri on vacation, and went to the studio to hear the song and said that he wanted to contribute to it and added rap verses of his own. Dupri produced " The One " and " You Had Your Chance ". He said that they wanted to stick to the " same familiar sound " from his previous collaborations with Carey. Carey said " The One " was a personal song, which was about being hurt in past relationships and the uncertainty about forming new ones. Carey decided to experiment with a live band for the album. In April 2002, she met 7 Aurelius and asked him to produce songs for the album. They flew to Nassau, Bahamas and recorded a mixture of mid @-@ tempo and up @-@ tempo tracks and ballads with a live band. 7 Aurelius said that Carey was " an amazing writer " and described the process of recording :

<|endoftext|> However, Hamels left spring training on March 16 after feeling tightness between innings, and flew to Philadelphia to have his left elbow examined by Dr. Michael <unk>. " This will obviously set me back a couple of days, and I don 't think that should be a big deal ", said Hamels. <unk> found no structural damage in his arm, yet Hamels still did not pitch on Opening Day as expected ; Myers did for the third consecutive season.

In July, the Phillies augmented their starting rotation by acquiring two former Cy Young Award winners in Cliff Lee and Pedro Martínez from a trade and a free agent signing respectively. Due to his early season injury struggles, Hamels posted a 10 – 11 record and a 4 @.@ 32 ERA in the regular season, his first major league season in which he posted a <unk> record, and the worst ERA of his career to that point.

Nevertheless, the Phillies won the series, three games to one. He earned the win in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series as the Phillies beat the Dodgers, 8 – 6. Hamels started Game 3 of the World Series against the New York Yankees, pitching 4 1 ⁄ 3 innings, allowing 5 earned runs and taking the loss as the Yankees won that game 8 @-@ 5.

This was discovered in the earliest nuclear reactors built by the American Manhattan Project for plutonium production. Fortunately the designers had made provisions in the design to increase the reactor's reactivity ( the number of neutrons per fission that go on to fission other atoms of nuclear fuel ). 135Xe reactor poisoning played a major role in the <unk> disaster. A <unk> or decrease of power of a reactor can result in buildup of 135Xe and getting the reactor into the iodine pit. 
<|endoftext|> Under adverse conditions, relatively high concentrations of radioactive xenon isotopes may be found emanating from nuclear reactors due to the release of fission products from cracked fuel rods, or <unk> of uranium in cooling water. 
<|endoftext|> Because xenon is a <unk> for two parent isotopes, xenon isotope ratios in meteorites are a powerful tool for studying the formation of the solar system. The iodine @-@ xenon method of dating gives the time <unk> between nucleosynthesis and the condensation of a solid object from the solar nebula. In 1960, physicist John H. Reynolds discovered that certain meteorites contained an isotopic anomaly in the form of an overabundance of xenon @-@ 129. He inferred that this was a decay product of radioactive iodine @-@ 129. This isotope is produced slowly by cosmic ray <unk> and nuclear fission, but is produced in quantity only in supernova explosions. As the half @-@ life of 129I is comparatively short on a <unk> time scale, only 16 million years, this demonstrated that only a short time had passed between the supernova and the time the meteorites had solidified and trapped the 129I. These two events ( supernova and <unk> of gas cloud ) were inferred to have happened during the early history of the Solar System, as the 129I isotope was likely generated before the Solar System was formed, but not long before, and <unk> the solar gas cloud with isotopes from a second source. This supernova source may also have caused collapse of the solar gas cloud. 
<|endoftext|> In a similar way, xenon isotopic ratios such as 129Xe / <unk> and <unk> / <unk> are also a powerful tool for understanding planetary differentiation and early outgassing. For example, The atmosphere of Mars shows a xenon abundance similar to that of Earth : 0 @.@ 08 parts per million, however Mars shows a higher proportion of 129Xe than the Earth or the Sun. As this isotope is generated by radioactive decay, the result may indicate that Mars lost most of its primordial atmosphere, possibly within the first 100 million years after the planet was formed. In another example, excess 129Xe found in carbon dioxide well gases from New Mexico was believed to be from the decay of mantle @-@ derived gases soon after Earth's formation.

<|endoftext|> Heavy rain fell in association with the depression in parts of Florida and Georgia. A maximum of 6 @.@ 74 in ( 171 mm ) fell in Orlando while several other areas recorded over 3 in ( 76 mm ) of rain. Over land, wind gusts reached 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) in some locations. Offshore, swells produced by the system reached 10 ft ( 3 @.@ 0 m ), impacting several vessels in the region. Minor beach erosion and coastal flooding was reported in parts of South Carolina as a result of the storm. In parts of coastal Georgia, high water resulted in several road closures and flooded a few homes.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Hurricane Fran ( Bravo ) = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The final hurricane of the season, Fran, originated from an area of convection north of Hispaniola on October 1. By October 4, the system interacted with a mid @-@ tropospheric trough near the southeast United States, resulting in the formation of a surface low. Tracking eastward, showers and thunderstorms began to develop around the circulation ; however, the structure of the system was not fully tropical. Late on October 8, the cyclone had become sufficiently organized to be classified a subtropical depression. Cold air from the remnants of a cold front became entrained within the circulation ; however, the cold air gradually warmed. The following day, winds increased to gale @-@ force and the depression was upgraded to a subtropical storm, at which time it was given the name Bravo. 
<|endoftext|> By October 10, Bravo had intensified substantially, as hurricane hunters recorded hurricane @-@ force winds roughly 15 mi ( 25 km ) from the center of the storm. Following this finding, the National Hurricane Center reclassified the system as a tropical system and renamed it Fran, dropping its previous designation of Bravo. <unk> generally eastward by a deep surface low in the westerlies, Fran accelerated towards the Azores Islands. Shortly after bypassing the islands on October 12, the central pressure of Fran decreased to 978 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 88 inHg ), the lowest recorded in relation to the hurricane. Shortly after reaching this intensity, the hurricane transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and quickly merged with a cold front off the coast of France. Although Fran passed near the Azores, no impact was recorded on any of the islands. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Tropical Storm Gilda = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The precursor to Tropical Storm Gilda was a large convective system partially due to a tropical wave. It gradually became better organized over the northwestern Caribbean Sea, and on October 15, a tropical depression formed off the coast of Nicaragua. As it drifted to the northeast, it strengthened to a tropical storm, peaking at 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) winds. Before it hit the coast of Cuba, it weakened enough to cause only minor damage. By the time it struck the island, it had become very disorganized in nature. 
<|endoftext|> On October 24, cool, dry air entered the newly developed convection, and as a result it transitioned into a subtropical cyclone. Gilda became the first tropical system to pass through a subtropical stage prior to becoming extratropical. The large circulation continued northeast before becoming extratropical on October 27. The remnants of Gilda intensified as they tracked near Atlantic Canada, attaining a central pressure of 968 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 58 inHg ) near Cape Race, Newfoundland. The system eventually dissipated near southern Greenland on October 29. 
<|endoftext|> Gilda caused heavy rain and mudslides in Jamaica, destroying six homes and killing six people. In Cuba, Gilda dropped over 6 in ( 150 mm ) of rain, while 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) winds were reported in the northern part of the country. In the Bahamas, Gilda caused significant crop damage from heavy rainfall and high tides. The storm's persistent strong currents and easterly winds caused moderate beach erosion on the East Coast of the United States, mostly along the Florida coast. The extratropical remnants of the storm produced hurricane @-@ force wind gusts over parts of Atlantic Canada, peaking at 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) ; however, no damage was reported.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In addition to the eight named storms of 1973 and two notable tropical depressions, there were several minor systems that were classified as depressions by the National Hurricane Center.

They were difficult to update, they could not learn, they were " brittle " ( i.e., they could make grotesque mistakes when given unusual inputs ), and they fell prey to problems ( such as the qualification problem ) that had been identified years earlier. Expert systems proved useful, but only in a few special contexts. 
<|endoftext|> In the late 80s, the Strategic Computing Initiative cut funding to AI " deeply and brutally. " New leadership at DARPA had decided that AI was not " the next wave " and directed funds towards projects that seemed more likely to produce immediate results. 
<|endoftext|> By 1991, the impressive list of goals penned in 1981 for Japan's Fifth Generation Project had not been met.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In the late 80s, several researchers advocated a completely new approach to artificial intelligence, based on robotics. They believed that, to show real intelligence, a machine needs to have a body — it needs to perceive, move, survive and deal with the world. They argued that these <unk> skills are essential to higher level skills like commonsense reasoning and that abstract reasoning was actually the least interesting or important human skill ( see Moravec's paradox ). They advocated building intelligence " from the bottom up. " 
<|endoftext|> The approach revived ideas from <unk> and control theory that had been unpopular since the sixties. Another precursor was David <unk>, who had come to MIT in the late 70s from a successful background in theoretical <unk> to lead the group studying vision. He rejected all symbolic approaches ( both McCarthy's logic and Minsky's frames ), arguing that AI needed to understand the physical machinery of vision from the bottom up before any symbolic processing took place. ( <unk>'s work would be cut short by leukemia in 1980. ) 
<|endoftext|> In a 1990 paper, " <unk> Don 't Play Chess, " robotics researcher Rodney Brooks took direct aim at the physical symbol system hypothesis, arguing that symbols are not always necessary since " the world is its own best model. It is always exactly up to date. It always has every detail there is to be known. The trick is to sense it appropriately and often enough. " In the 80s and 90s, many cognitive scientists also rejected the symbol processing model of the mind and argued that the body was essential for reasoning, a theory called the embodied mind thesis.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The field of AI, now more than a half a century old, finally achieved some of its oldest goals. It began to be used successfully throughout the technology industry, although somewhat behind the scenes. Some of the success was due to increasing computer power and some was achieved by focusing on specific isolated problems and pursuing them with the highest standards of scientific accountability. Still, the reputation of AI, in the business world at least, was less than pristine. Inside the field there was little agreement on the reasons for AI's failure to fulfill the dream of human level intelligence that had captured the imagination of the world in the 1960s. Together, all these factors helped to fragment AI into competing <unk> focused on particular problems or approaches, sometimes even under new names that disguised the <unk> pedigree of " artificial intelligence ".

Sir John Colborne suggested Port Sarnia. On 4 January 1836, the name was formally adopted by a vote of 26 to 16, and Colborne also named the nearby village Moore after British military hero Sir John Moore.

In the courtyard of St. George's Church is a sarcophagus. St. George's Church has continued to serve as a place of worship into the modern era and has been the site of archaeological excavation since the mid @-@ 19th century. Mass is still held at its altar on certain occasions. In 1882 the Palestine Exploration Fund's Survey of Western Palestine described Jifna as an Important Christian village, with a Latin Church and a convent. Also in the 1880s, Jifna was frequently <unk> by Ottoman authorities. It also came into consistent armed conflict with another Christian village, Bir Zeit, which in one incident, resulted in the deaths of five men from that village. In retaliation, residents of Bir Zeit uprooted and burned 125 of Jifna's olive groves.

After a brief period of military rule, Jifna and its region came under the control of the League of Nations British Mandate, in 1922. In 1947 the United Nations proposed the <unk> of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jifna being a part of the projected Arab state. However, after the 1948 Arab @-@ Israeli War the whole West Bank region, including Jifna, was annexed by Transjordan to form the Kingdom of Jordan, and the Arab state was stillborn. In 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank, after their victory in the Six @-@ Day War.

Thus, its administrative and civil affairs were transferred to the <unk>, while security matters remained in Israeli control. Throughout the ongoing Second Intifada, which began in 2000, Jifna has not experienced violence to the same extent as other parts of the West Bank, such as in nearby Ramallah, but its residents face travel restrictions and economic hardship.

After the creation of the IR8 demo tape, Townsend and Jason Newsted had begun work on a new project called <unk>, which they described as " heavier than Strapping Young Lad ". When the IR8 tape was leaked, Newsted's Metallica bandmates James <unk> and Lars <unk> learned of the project. <unk> was " fucking <unk> " that Newsted was playing outside the band, and Newsted was prevented by his bandmates from working on any more side projects. With the project stalled, Townsend instead wrote the album himself, <unk> it Physicist. Townsend assembled his Strapping Young Lad bandmates to record it, the only time this lineup was featured on a Devin Townsend album. The thrash @-@ influenced Physicist was released in June 2000, and is generally considered a low point in Townsend's career. Hoglan and the rest of the band were dissatisfied with the way the sound was mixed, and Townsend considers it his worst album to date. 
<|endoftext|> Feeling he had " ostracized a bunch of fans " with Physicist, Townsend felt he had the chance to make a more personal and honest record. Townsend was inspired one morning while driving across Canada with his band, and looked to write an " introspective " album dedicated to his homeland. He produced and recorded Terria, a " highly illustrated stream @-@ of @-@ consciousness " album, with Gene Hoglan on drums, Craig McFarland on bass and Jamie Meyer on keyboards. Townsend cited <unk>'s White <unk> as an inspiration for the album. Terria was released in November 2001.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Townsend's solo run lasted until 2002. After a five @-@ year break from recording, Strapping Young Lad reunited to record a new album. Townsend credits the album, Strapping Young Lad, as an emotional response to the attacks of September 11, 2001, in the United States. " If the world's about to blow up, " said Townsend, " let's write the soundtrack for it. " The album's lyrics were based more around fear and insecurity than the " hostile " lyrics of City. Musically, Strapping Young Lad was less industrial than City, and more reminiscent of death metal, with a " larger @-@ than @-@ life " rock production style. Townsend cited Front Line Assembly, <unk>, and <unk>'s Passage as influences. The self @-@ titled album was released in February 2003. It received lukewarm reviews, with critics finding it inferior to City, but it was the band's first charting album, entering at <unk> place on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart. 
<|endoftext|> While Strapping Young Lad was being reunited, Townsend formed a new, permanent band " on par with Strapping " to record and tour for his solo releases. The Devin Townsend Band consisted of Brian " Beav " Waddell on guitar, Mike Young on bass, Ryan Van <unk> on drums, and Dave Young on keyboards. Townsend performed guitar, vocals, and production, as he did in Strapping Young Lad. Townsend worked on the band's first album, Accelerated Evolution, at the same time he was working on Strapping Young Lad, spending half the week on one and half on the other. Accelerated Evolution, named for the pace of putting a new band together in under a year, was released a month after Strapping Young Lad. Mike G. of Metal Maniacs called it " the album of the year ", praising it for " the hard @-@ to @-@ accomplish trick of being extreme yet accessible, simultaneously heavy'n'<unk>'yet <unk> and beautiful. " Prior to the formation of the Devin Townsend Band, Townsend had represented his solo releases live with the Strapping Young Lad lineup ; the band would play one set of Strapping Young Lad songs and one set of Devin Townsend songs. After the release of Accelerated Evolution, Townsend's two bands toured separately for their separate albums. 
<|endoftext|> Strapping Young Lad began working on their next album, Alien, in March 2004. Feeling that the band's previous album did not live up to expectations, Townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme. To prepare for the new album, Townsend stopped taking the medication prescribed to treat his bipolar disorder. " I think that as an artist, in order for me to get to the next plateau, I kind of feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy, " he explains. " And Alien was no exception with that. " Although Townsend considered the album an " impenetrable mass of <unk> ", it was well received on its release, selling 3 @,@ 697 copies in

<|endoftext|> Having borne the burden of the long days of patrolling, reconnaissance and minor engagements with the advancing Austrian, German and Ottoman columns prior to the battle, the 1st and 2nd Light Horse Brigades had alone withstood the attack from midnight on 3 / 4 August until dawn on 4 August, as well as continuing to fight during the long days of battle.

The next morning, infantry in the 42nd Division was ordered to advance eastwards at 04 : 00 and occupy a line from Bir el Mamluk to Bir Katia, while the 52nd ( Lowland ) Division was to advance from Abu Hamra and prolong the infantry line of the 42nd Division to the north @-@ east. Although they carried out their orders during their two @-@ day march from Pelusium Station to Katia, infantry in the 127th ( Manchester ) Brigade lost 800 men, victims to thirst and the sun ; other infantry brigades suffered similarly. It became clear that the infantry could not go on, and they ceased to be employed in the advance. Indeed, it was necessary for the <unk> Camel Corps and Yeomanry <unk>, as well as the medical services, to search the desert for those who had been left behind. 
<|endoftext|> The Mobile Column in the south, consisting of the Imperial Camel Brigade, the 11th Light Horse, and the mounted City of London Yeomanry Regiments ( less two squadrons ), advanced from Ferdan and the <unk> railhead to attack the German and Ottoman left flank, working through Bir El Mageibra, Bir El <unk> and Hod El Bayud. They found Mageibra evacuated on 5 August. After camping there for the night, they fought strong hostile forces between Bayud and Mageibra the following day, but could make no impression. Some days later, on 8 August, the Mobile Column did succeed in getting round the Ottoman flank, but was too weak to have any effect and retired to Bir Bayud.

In May 2007, Furtado mentioned the possibility of a sixth or seventh single, mentioning the examples of Nickelback's All the Right Reasons and The Pussycat Dolls'<unk> as albums that were being supported by seven singles at the time. Furtado said she liked the possibility because she thought Loose was good and " want [ ed ] people to hear as much of it as possible " before she took time off. Two other songs, " Te Busqué " and " No Hay Igual ", were released as singles in other regions of the world. " Te Busqué " was the lead single in Spain because of the limited success hip @-@ hop / R & B @-@ influenced songs in the style of " Promiscuous " and " Maneater " achieved in the country. It was not released in the United States, but it was given airplay on Latin music radio stations and reached the top forty on Billboard's Latin Pop Airplay chart.

<|endoftext|> The Swedes were building three additional hemmemas at the shipyards within the fortress of Sveaborg when it was surrendered to the Russians in 1808, and all three were incorporated in the Russian Navy.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Tradition and old records assert that southern Somalia, including the Mogadishu area, was inhabited very early by hunter @-@ gatherers of <unk> descent. Although most of these early inhabitants are believed to have been either overwhelmed, driven away or, in some cases, assimilated by later migrants to the area, physical traces of their occupation survive in certain ethnic minority groups inhabiting modern @-@ day <unk> and other parts of the south. The latter descendants include <unk> populations such as the <unk>, <unk>, the <unk> @-@ <unk>, and especially the <unk> @-@ <unk>. By the time of the arrival of peoples from the Cushitic <unk> ( <unk> and <unk> ) clan confederacy, who would go on to establish a local aristocracy, other Cushitic groups affiliated with the <unk> ( <unk> ) and <unk> ( Ma <unk> ) had already formed settlements of their own in the sub @-@ region. 
<|endoftext|> The ancient city of <unk> is believed to have been the predecessor state of Mogadishu. It is mentioned in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, a Greek travel document dating from the first century AD, as one of a series of commercial ports on the Somali <unk>. According to the Periplus, maritime trade already connected peoples in the Mogadishu area with other communities along the Indian Ocean coast. 
<|endoftext|> The Sultanate of Mogadishu later developed with the immigration of <unk> Arabs, a community whose earliest presence dates back to the 9th or 10th century. This evolved into the Muzaffar dynasty, a joint Somali @-@ Arab federation of rulers, and Mogadishu became closely linked with the powerful Somali Ajuran Sultanate. Following his visit to the city, the 12th century Syrian historian <unk> al @-@ <unk> wrote that it was inhabited by dark @-@ skinned <unk>, the ancestors of the modern <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> For many years, Mogadishu stood as the pre @-@ eminent city in the <unk> @-@ ul @-@ <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ), meaning " Land of the <unk>, " which was the medieval Arabic term for the Somali coast. By the time of the Moroccan traveller Ibn <unk>'s appearance on the Somali coast in 1331, the city was at the zenith of its prosperity. He described Mogadishu as " an exceedingly large city " with many rich merchants, which was famous for the high quality fabric that it exported to destinations including Egypt. <unk> added that the city was ruled by a Somali Sultan, Abu <unk> ibn <unk>'Umar, who was originally from Barbara in northern Somalia and spoke both Somali ( referred to

<|endoftext|> Many critics lauded the album as Powderfinger's best work ; one stated that the album was " the Finger's <unk> Glory ", however, others were critical of the " imitation " contained in the album. Overall, the album won five ARIA Music Awards in 2001 and was certified platinum seven times, and earned an eighth in 2004. Odyssey Number Five was Powderfinger's first album to chart in the United States, and the band toured extensively around North America to promote its release. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Background, recording, and production = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> In a 1997 interview, Powderfinger bassist John Collins hinted that the group's next album would be similar to their previous album, Internationalist, while frontman Bernard Fanning said in September 2000 that the lyrics on the album, like those on " Waiting for the Sun ", were his " most personal and direct yet ". Fanning said his lyrics were based on the " obstacles in the way of being in a relationship, especially in our work situation ". 
<|endoftext|> Powderfinger worked with producer Nick <unk> on Odyssey Number Five, as they had done on Internationalist, finishing the album in August 2000 after six weeks of recording. The band spent this time ensuring higher quality songs than on Internationalist, which had featured out @-@ of @-@ tune guitars on " Passenger ". 
<|endoftext|> Odyssey Number Five was Powderfinger's shortest album when recorded, running for approximately 45 minutes. The focus of the album was on restraint, with more simplistic lyrics than previously, and with a plain and simple message intended. Fanning said of his songwriting ethic : " You try and make it something that ’ s got some substance, but also, you can never do that at the cost of it having relevance to what you ’ re singing. " Powderfinger manager Paul <unk> commented that " their ethos is to be pushing the limits of their songwriting ability ". 
<|endoftext|> Like Powderfinger's previous album Internationalist, Odyssey Number Five commented on social and political issues heavily, with the primary point of focus being Aboriginal affairs. The lyrics of " Like a Dog " attacked former Prime Minister of Australia John Howard's Liberal government for its treatment of Indigenous Australians, and for breaking the " relaxed and comfortable " promise he made in the Australian federal election, 1996. Lead singer Bernard Fanning related this to the band's other ethical <unk> — refusing to appear on Hey Hey it's Saturday, for its anti @-@ gay commentary, or not allowing Powderfinger songs to be used in <unk>, amongst others — stating, " We're not here to set an example. We just want to be happy with ourselves and not end up with a guilty conscience. " Fanning said that despite " Like a Dog " being about a political issue, it was not a political song, rather just Powderfinger " voicing our opinions ". The band worked with boxer Anthony <unk> on the song's music video, whom Fanning praised as " the perfect lead, in terms of what the song is about and the fact that he ’ s prepared to speak up for what he believes in. " 
<|endoftext|> As well as providing social commentary, Odyssey Number Five also discussed love, a recurring motif in Fanning's songwriting. Fanning noted that one of the causes of this was his passion for soul and gospel music, stating that he " listen [ s ] to a lot of soul music that's <unk> about love and how good it makes you feel ". Lead guitarist Ian <unk> agreed, and also noted that the band as a whole were fully committed to Fanning's lyrics, stating " It's really important for us to agree with what Bernard is singing. " 
<|endoftext|> Odyssey Number Five marked Powderfinger's first successful attempt to enter the United States market. Fanning told Billboard in a 2001 interview that the band were not taking anything for granted, however, stating, " In America, we haven 't really done any work yet to deserve any major popularity ", with the " <unk> " on previous albums failing to reach the American mainstream. Powderfinger toured extensively around the country, performing in 22 cities. As a result of these efforts, " My Happiness " was briefly placed on rotation on <unk> @-@ FM and several other radio stations. The song ultimately peaked at # 23 on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. This success was assisted by the band appearing on the Late Show with David Letterman, and by supporting Coldplay on tour. Guitarist Darren Middleton summarised their work in the United States by stating " This year has been a bit of a blur. " 
<|endoftext|> " Steve Turner's Van Morrison : Too Late To Stop Now is not the final answer on Morrison – only Morrison could give that – but he does provide insights and updates as well as a solid background on Morrison's early life. " Writing for The Irish Times, John Boland was critical of the book's text but wrote positively of its images : " Steve Turner's Van Morrison : Too Late to Stop Now, has a <unk>, <unk> style text and isn 't very <unk> about the great man, but it has some splendid pictures and in its coffee table format is well worth the asking price ". A review in the Herald Sun was critical : " Too Late To Stop Now is more suited to the coffee table than a library shelf. It is browsing material, <unk> with <unk>, album covers, PR shots, posters and prints. The words are mere <unk>, there to hold the pictures in place. " The Herald Sun noted that the author left out critical quotes from individuals that knew Van Morrison, and questioned Turner's <unk>.

He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s when his songs chronicled social unrest, although Dylan repudiated suggestions from journalists that he was a spokesman for his generation. Nevertheless, early songs such as " Blowin'in the Wind " and " The Times They Are a @-@ <unk>'" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti @-@ war movements. After he left his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six @-@ minute single " Like a Rolling Stone " altered the range of popular music in 1965. His mid @-@ 1960s recordings, backed by rock musicians, reached the top end of the United States music charts while also attracting <unk> and criticism from others in the folk movement. 
<|endoftext|> Dylan's lyrics have incorporated various political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. They defied existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and <unk> musical genres. His recording career, spanning more than 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song — from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but songwriting is considered his greatest contribution. 
<|endoftext|> Since 1994, Dylan has published six books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries. As a musician, Dylan has sold more than 100 million records, making him one of the best @-@ selling artists of all time. He has also received numerous awards including eleven Grammy Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and an Academy Award. Dylan has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame, and Songwriters Hall of Fame. The Pulitzer Prize jury in 2008 awarded him a special citation for " his profound impact on popular music and American culture, marked by lyrical compositions of extraordinary poetic power. " In May 2012, Dylan received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama.

<|endoftext|> conversation. 
<|endoftext|> Goffman explains that the way a conversation is keyed is critical to understanding the intent behind many utterances in everyday speech. Key is probably best understood as the tone of the dialogue which can change numerous times during an interaction. <unk> a change in key is one way that framing often takes place, “ special brackets will have to be introduced should he want to say something in a relatively serious way : " <unk> aside, " " Now, I'm really serious about this, " and other such <unk> become necessary as a means of momentarily down <unk> the flow of words. ” 
<|endoftext|> <unk> Richard <unk> builds heavily on Goffman ’ s work, specifically on the idea of key, in his work pertaining to an analysis of the performance frame. <unk> details that a performance is dependent on it being properly keyed, without this, the display will not be successful. His work on performance analyses is deeply <unk> to what Goffman establishes here in “ Frame Analyses. ” 
<|endoftext|> <unk> is one other element to framing that is essential. " The participants will be bound by norms of good manners : through frequency and length of turns at talk, through topics avoided, through <unk> in regard to references about self, through attention offered eagerly or begrudgingly @-@ through all these means, rank and social relationship will be given their due. " Certain things can and will be said in one scenario that would never be uttered in another. An awareness of these social <unk> is critical, just as is an awareness of the audience. Depending on who you ’ re speaking with ( a teacher, a child, a loved one, a friend, a pet, etc. ) you will curve your speech to fit the frame of what your intended audience is expecting. 
<|endoftext|> Goffman uses the metaphor of conversation being a stage play. A plays tone will shift throughout the performance due to the actions taken by the actors ; this is similar to how a discussion is keyed – based on what either person says or does over the course of an interaction, the key will change accordingly. The parallels go further, though. Goffman also claims that a speaker details a drama more often than they provide information. They invite the listener to <unk> and, as was explained above, they ’ re often not meant to be stirred to take action, but rather to show appreciation ; during a play this generally takes the form of applause. 
<|endoftext|> Other similarities include engaging in the suspense the speaker is attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside the knowledge that the performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains “ the argument that much of talk consists of <unk> and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame @-@ indeed, the close relevance of <unk> @-@ for the organization of talk. ” Lastly, because the <unk> of strips is not <unk>, but rather <unk>, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.

In the book Goffman examined over 500 advertisements in order to find general patterns in stereotypical gender representation, which he placed into six categories :

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The soundtrack of the film was written by Howard Blake, and is scored entirely for string orchestra in the style of early 20th Century British music.

<|endoftext|> Howard Blake recalls : " I went to a viewing and saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti @-@ war theme, but a certain amount of'found'choral music had already been laid in by the editors... I explained that I loved the film and I thought the choral / orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and I felt a score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only. " Blake decided to compose his score to match the key of the Schubert Mass, in order for the music to continue seamlessly. However, during the recording session with his orchestra, the Sinfonia of London, he found that the Schubert piece was running slow and therefore flat, and he had to ask the players to tune flat to match his intended key. 
<|endoftext|> Due to the small budget of the film, Blake agreed " in lieu of a reasonable fee " to retain the copyright to his music. The score was subsequently arranged into a suite for string orchestra, and is available on CD in a recording by the English Northern <unk> conducted by Paul Daniel.

<|endoftext|> c. 1550 – 1070 BC ). In Greek and Roman times, from <unk> BC to the early centuries AD, deities from across the Mediterranean world were revered in Egypt, but the native gods remained, and they often absorbed the cults of these newcomers into their own worship. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Characteristics = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Modern knowledge of Egyptian beliefs about the gods is mostly drawn from religious writings produced by the nation's scribes and priests. These people were the elite of Egyptian society and were very distinct from the general populace, most of whom were illiterate. Little is known about how well this broader population knew or understood the sophisticated ideas that the elite developed. <unk>'perceptions of the divine may have differed from those of the priests. The populace may, for example, have mistaken the religion's symbolic statements about the gods and their actions for literal truth. But overall, what little is known about popular religious belief is consistent with the elite tradition. The two traditions form a largely cohesive vision of the gods and their nature. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = <unk> = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Most Egyptian deities represent natural or social phenomena. The gods were generally said to be <unk> in these phenomena — to be present within nature. The types of phenomena they represented include physical places and objects as well as abstract concepts and forces. The god Shu was the <unk> of all the world's air ; the goddess <unk> oversaw a limited region of the earth, the <unk> <unk> ; and the god <unk> personified the abstract notion of perception. Major gods often had many roles and were involved in several types of phenomena. For instance, <unk> was the god of <unk> Island in the midst of the Nile, the river that was essential to Egyptian civilization. He was credited with producing the annual Nile flood that fertilized the nation's farmland. Perhaps as an outgrowth of this life @-@ giving function, he was said to create all living things, <unk> their bodies on a <unk>'s wheel. Gods could share the same role in nature ; Ra, Atum, <unk>, Horus, and other deities acted as sun gods. Despite their diverse functions, most gods had an overarching role in common : maintaining maat, the universal order that was a central principle of Egyptian religion and was itself personified as a goddess. But some deities represented disruption to maat. Most prominently, <unk> was the force of chaos, constantly threatening to <unk> the order of the universe, and Set was an ambivalent member of divine society who could both fight disorder and foment it. 
<|endoftext|> Not all aspects of existence were seen as deities. Although many deities were connected with the Nile, no god personified it in the way that Ra personified the sun. Short @-@ lived phenomena, like <unk> or <unk>, were not represented by gods ; neither were elements like fire and water or many other components of the world. 
<|endoftext|> The roles of each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature to take on new characteristics. As a result, gods'roles are difficult to <unk> or define. But despite their flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. Not even the creator god could reach beyond the boundaries of the cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though she was said to be the <unk> of the gods, was not <unk>. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that, as beliefs about the god Amun evolved, he was thought to approach omniscience and <unk> and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not. 
<|endoftext|> The deities with the most limited and specialized domains are often called " minor divinities " or " demons " in modern writing, although there is no firm definition for these terms. Among these lesser deities, Egyptologist Claude <unk> draws a distinction between " <unk> " — specialized patron spirits of certain places, objects, or activities, such as the sea or marsh god <unk> @-@ <unk> and the harvest goddess <unk> — and demons, who have a more dangerous character. Many demons are hostile, causing illness and other troubles among humans. Their power can also be protective ; they may guard certain places in the Duat, the realm of the dead, or advise and watch over humans. Egyptians believed the landscape was full of these unpredictable divine powers. Demons often act as servants and messengers to the greater gods, but their position in the hierarchy is not fixed. The protective deities <unk> and <unk> originally had minor, demon @-@ like roles, but over time they came to be credited with great influence.

The company ranged in size from six to nine people at varying stages of the game's development. Flower was intended by Chen to primarily to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as " an emotional shelter ". Chen described the game as " an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature ". He decided on a " nature " theme early in the development process, saying that he " had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal in your living room, it leads you to somewhere else. I thought ; wouldn 't it be nice if it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature. " Chen designed the game around the idea that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. To make Flower have the " emotional spectrum " that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a " fun " game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. In 2008, during Flower's development, Chen was named to the MIT Technology Review <unk> as one of the top 35 <unk> in the world under the age of 35. 
<|endoftext|> After Flower was released to critical praise and awards, Chen and Thatgamecompany moved on to their next game, Journey. Journey was intended by Chen to focus on the element of communication and social interaction in video games. Since in most games the communication between players is focused on specific goals, in Journey Chen intended for the player to be able to either play alone or to come across other players, but not be able to communicate with them directly. Instead, players have to build relationships with each other through their actions, helping each other or leaving as they choose. Journey was released on the PlayStation Network on March 13, 2012, and has received critical acclaim.

He also names Final Fantasy VII as an influence, and the game that he took his adopted name from. He personally plays games " competitively ", including titles such as Street Fighter IV and StarCraft. He feels he has a competitive nature, which he has turned towards " winning " at being a game designer by creating games that are unlike what is in the market rather than towards creating competitive games. As he was raised in China and works in America, Chen feels that he cannot fully relate to either culture as a game designer. As such, instead of trying to make games that fit perfectly with one culture he tries to make games that tap into feelings that are universal and independent of culture. 
<|endoftext|> When Chen quit Maxis to re @-@ join Thatgamecompany, he did so knowing that it would mean taking less pay and having a less stable career. He felt, though, that it was important to the industry and medium as a whole to create games that provoked different emotional responses in the player than just excitement or fear. While Chen is not opposed to making action games, and his company has made internal " exciting " games that were well received at Sony, he feels that there is no point to Thatgamecompany commercially producing games like that instead of working for existing game developers, as they would not be making anything new that justified the cost of remaining an independent studio. Similarly, Chen does not intend for Thatgamecompany to make " big budget blockbuster games ", as the pressure on profits that that <unk> would <unk> the innovation that he wants Thatgamecompany to focus on. Chen believes that for video games to become a mature medium like film, the industry as a whole needs to create a wide range of emotional responses to their games, similar to how film has thriller, romance, and comedy genres based on the emotions they provoke. He feels that there are only three ways for video games to impact adults in the same way they do children : " <unk>, whereby the work reveals a new perspective about the world that you have not seen before, " by " emotionally touching someone, " and " by creating a social environment where the intellectual or emotional stimulation could happen from other people.

Peel, despite praising the storylines and characterisation, suggests that the " tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek " humour of Stingray is less evident. Where Thunderbirds improves on its predecessor, Peel believes, is in its rejection of fantasy plot devices, child and animal characters, comical and stereotyped villains and what he terms the " standard Anderson <unk> " : female characters, marginalised in earlier series, are more commonly seen to play active and sometimes heroic roles. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> the attention to detail of the series'launch sequences, Jonathan Bignell argues that part of the motivation for dedicating large amounts of screen time to the Thunderbird craft is the need to compensate for the limited mobility of the puppet cast. The focus on futuristic machines has also been explored by cultural historian Nicholas J. Cull, who comments that of all the Andersons'series, Thunderbirds is the most evocative of a recurring theme : the " necessity of the human component of the machine ", whereby the failures of new technology are overcome by " brave human beings and technology working together ". This makes the series'vision of the <unk> " wonderfully humanistic and <unk> ". O 'Brien similarly praises this optimism, comparing the Tracy family to guardian <unk>. Writing for Wired UK magazine, Warren Ellis asserts that the series'scientific vision could inspire the next generation of " mad and frightening engineers ", adding that Thunderbirds " trades in vast, <unk> concepts... immense and very beautiful ideas as solutions to problems. " 
<|endoftext|> Thomas argues that the world of Thunderbirds is similar to the 1960s to the extent that contemporary capitalism and class structures appear to have survived mostly intact. He also observes, however, that wealth and high social status are often depicted as character flaws rather than strengths. According to Thomas, a contributing factor to the series'lasting popularity is the realism of IR's machines. Newman, for his part, suggests that " the point isn 't realism. The 21st century of Thunderbirds is detailed... but also de @-@ populated, a high @-@ tech <unk> ". He is more negative in his comparisons of contemporary and future values, noting the " square, almost 50s " attitudes to race, gender and class. With regard to stereotyping, Hood comments that he " would be <unk> if [ villains ] didn 't seem to be recognisable by their <unk> ". Cull, by contrast, considers the series largely progressive on the subject of race, arguing that it rejects negative stereotyping through the use of " positive non @-@ white characters " such as Kyrano and Tin @-@ Tin. However, he deems many of the one @-@ off villains derivative, commenting that these characters are typically presented as " corrupt businessmen, <unk> and gangsters familiar from crime films ". 
<|endoftext|> Various commentators – including Bignell, Cull and O 'Brien – have also discussed Thunderbirds as a product of the Cold War era. Bignell comments that the Hood's Oriental appearance and mysterious powers draw parallels with James Bond villains and fears of China operating as " a'third force'antagonistic to the West ". Cull observes that, despite the series'focus on the dangers of nuclear technology, the Thunderbird machines contradict this particular theme : in their case, " an image of technology associated with the threat of Cold War mass destruction – the rocket emerging from the hidden <unk> – was appropriated and deployed to save life rather than to take it. " He argues that the series <unk> more closely to cultural norms by drawing on the " Cold War cult of the secret agent whose skills defend the home from enemies unknown ", noting Lady Penelope's role as a spy in addition to two episodes ( " 30 Minutes After Noon " and " The Man from <unk> " ) that are heavily influenced by the James Bond novels and film adaptations.

On the night of December 23, Khánh convinced his fellow officers to join him in lobbying Hương to declare Taylor persona non <unk> and expel him from South Vietnam. They were confident Hương could not reject them and side with a foreign power at the expense of the military that had installed him, and made preparations to meet him the next day. Khánh also told Hương that if Taylor was not ejected, he and the other generals would hold a media conference and release " detailed accounts " of the ambassador's confrontation with the quartet and his " ultimatum to General Khánh " the day after. However, someone in the junta was a CIA informant and reported the incident, allowing American officials to individually lobby the officers to change their stance. At the same time, the Americans informed Hương if Taylor was expelled, US funding would stop. The next day, the generals changed their mind and when they met Hương at his office, only asked him to formally denounce Taylor's behavior in his meetings with Khánh and his quartet and to " take appropriate measures to preserve the honor of all the Vietnamese armed forces and to keep national prestige intact ". 
<|endoftext|> On December 24, Khánh issued a declaration of independence from " foreign manipulation ", and condemned " colonialism ", explicitly accusing Taylor of <unk> his power. At the time, Khánh was also secretly negotiating with the communists, hoping to put together a peace deal so he could expel the Americans from Vietnam, although this effort did not lead anywhere in the two months before he was forced out of power. For his part, Taylor privately told Americans journalists that Khánh was expressing opposition to the US merely because he knew he had lost Washington's confidence. Taylor said Khánh was completely <unk> and was stirring up anti @-@ American sentiment purely to try to shore up his political prospects, not because he thought US policy was harmful to South Vietnam.

However, the New York Herald Tribune said it was dangerous to pressure South Vietnam too much, citing the instability that followed the American support for the coup against Diệm, who had resisted US advice so often. It said " The issue is not General Khánh versus General Taylor. It is whether the Vietnamese still have the will to exist as an independent state. " The newspaper said if the answer was yes, then both Washington and Saigon would have to look beyond personalities. 
<|endoftext|> Angry with Deepe for airing Khánh's grievances against him, Taylor invited every other US journalist in Saigon to this private briefing.

However, someone at the briefing informed Deepe of what Taylor had said, and she published the remarks on December 25 under the title " Taylor <unk> Mask Off Khánh ".

As many as 121 ministers were called to the Assembly, with nineteen others added later to replace those who did not attend or could no longer attend. It produced a new Form of Church Government, a Confession of Faith or statement of belief, two catechisms or manuals for religious instruction ( Shorter and Larger ), and a <unk> manual, the Directory for Public Worship, for the Churches of England and Scotland. The Confession and catechisms were adopted as doctrinal standards in the Church of Scotland and other Presbyterian churches, where they remain <unk>. <unk> versions of the Confession were also adopted in Congregational and Baptist churches in England and New England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

The Long Parliament was influenced by <unk>, a religious movement which sought to further reform the church. They were opposed to the religious policies of King Charles I and William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. As part of a military alliance with Scotland, Parliament agreed that the outcome of the Assembly would bring the English Church into closer conformity with the Church of Scotland. The Scottish Church was governed by a system of elected assemblies of elders called presbyterianism, rather than rule by bishops, called <unk>, which was used in the English church. Scottish commissioners attended and advised the Assembly as part of the agreement. <unk> over church government caused open division in the Assembly, despite attempts to maintain unity. The party of divines who favoured presbyterianism was in the majority, but political and military <unk> led to greater influence for the congregationalist party. Congregationalists favoured autonomy for individual congregations rather than the <unk> of congregations to regional and national assemblies entailed in presbyterianism. Parliament eventually adopted a presbyterian form of government, but it lacked the power the presbyterian divines desired. During the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, all of the documents of the Assembly were repudiated and episcopal church government was reinstated in England. 
<|endoftext|> The Assembly worked in the Reformed Protestant theological tradition, also known as <unk>. It took the Bible as the authoritative word of God, from which all theological reflection must be based. The divines were committed to the Reformed doctrine of <unk> — that God chooses certain men to be saved and enjoy eternal life rather than eternal punishment. There was some disagreement at the Assembly over the doctrine of particular redemption — that Christ died only for those chosen for salvation. The Assembly also held to Reformed covenant theology, a framework for interpreting the Bible.

<|endoftext|> Afterwards, John's coat ( which Gemma sold on <unk> ) began to manipulate its various new owners into murder, suicide, or other horrific acts until coming into the hands of a man from the U.S., who tried to kill John and Epiphany. During the time the coat was missing, John's magical abilities had begun to go out of control. John eventually resolves this, and he was re @-@ united with his coat. Since this, Gemma and John have a very <unk> relationship with one another, and she began a sexual relationship with Epiphany's crime @-@ boss father Terry in order to " punish " John.

Having lived a good and adventurous life, he happily accepts his fate rather than trying to fight it like he always does. When the last day came, Constantine was ambushed and shot in his own home right in front of a horrified Epiphany. After he died, Epiphany and Finn had an affair as a way to comfort each other. John's ghost saw them having sex in a graveyard and seemed to give his blessing, making the fates decide that John wasn 't going to try to come back to life. Then, of course, he did. He contacted Epiphany and asked her to help resurrect him by making him cigarettes from his ashes, which, after he smoked them, made him <unk> again. <unk> to disappear and live happily ever after with Epiphany, they moved to a tiny house in Ireland, courtesy of Finn, that was totally off the grid and far removed from any apparent trouble, the last place anyone would think to look for John. That didn 't last long, though, as John realized he can never run from his past. 
<|endoftext|> So John left Epiphany in Ireland and returned to England to confront Gemma. He stole the last dart holding the <unk> that killed his demon twin, but ultimately gave it back to Gemma and told her either she could kill him, and live her life without him in but consumed with guilt for killing him, or she could let him disappear from her life forever, without any guilt for murdering him. Gemma shot the dart at him, but John disappeared. The final panel of Hellblazer reveals John, looking shocked and much older than we 'd previously seen him, standing in a bar appropriately called " A Long Journey's End " surrounded by people, in front of a shelf full of bottles with the names of the comic's staff over the years.

Such technology was in an early stage of development, was too expensive, it did not have widespread political support, and very few large, established companies were embracing the sector. Even at the start of the 21st century, the term clean tech was not yet in the financial or business community ’ s vocabulary. But now, throughout much of the world, in trends large and small, there is " the beginning of a revolution that is changing the places where we live and work, the products we manufacture and purchase, and the development plans of cities, regional governments, and nations around the globe. " 
<|endoftext|> Pernick and Wilder define " clean tech " as " any product, service, or process that delivers value using limited or zero non @-@ renewable resources and / or creates significantly less waste than conventional offerings. " They highlight eight major clean technology sectors : solar power, wind power, <unk>, green buildings, personal transportation, the smart grid, mobile applications ( such as portable fuel cells ), and water filtration. The authors explain how investors, entrepreneurs, and individuals can profit from technological innovation in these areas. Pernick and Wilder identify some specific clean technologies, companies, and regions that are leading the way. 
<|endoftext|> The authors present a list of drivers for clean tech : " high energy prices, depleted natural resources, volatile sources of foreign oil, record deficits, and unprecedented environmental and security challenges ". The central message, which is repeated in almost every chapter, is that a clean tech revolution with benefit humanity worldwide, and will require significant collaboration between the public and private sectors. 
<|endoftext|> Pernick and Wilder present examples which show that the " clean tech revolution " is already under way. Very large corporations such as <unk>, Toyota and Sharp, and investment firms such as Goldman Sachs are making multibillion @-@ dollar investments in clean technology. <unk> clean tech cities are seen to include Copenhagen, where wind power generates 20 percent of Denmark's electricity, and Chicago, a leader in " green " buildings saving energy, heating and cooling costs. Statistics from the U.S. and from abroad, especially from China, India, Brazil, and Europe are presented. 
<|endoftext|> The authors'say that nuclear power and clean coal are not clean technologies. Apart from the risks associated with nuclear power, " multibillion @-@ dollar nuclear plants are simply not cost @-@ effective when compared with other energy sources.

<|endoftext|> Johnston was born in <unk>, Scotland, and his parents separated when he was an infant. He and his mother moved to Carlisle, where they lived in " poverty ". He became head chorister at Carlisle Cathedral, and was bullied at school because of his love of classical music. While some journalists have argued Britain's Got Talent producers took advantage of Johnston's background, others have hailed his story as inspirational. In 2009, he graduated from Trinity School.

Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the <unk> Jeremy <unk> and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a " stunning building among those extraordinary voices ". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that " it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him ". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from <unk> which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his <unk> and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister. 
<|endoftext|> In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and <unk> Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of <unk> <unk>, released in November 2008.

Amanda Holden, one of the competition's judges, was brought to tears, and the audience offered Johnston a standing ovation. Johnston was tipped as the favourite to win the competition. Later, Johnston described his initial audition as daunting, saying that " it was scary singing in front of 2 @,@ 500 people. I had never sang on stage before – then there was also Simon, Amanda and Piers ". He won his semi @-@ final heat on 27 May 2008, receiving the most public votes on the night and thereby qualifying for the final.

He finished in third place, behind the winner, the street dancer George Sampson and runners @-@ up, the dance group Signature. Johnston left the stage in tears, later saying that he " was upset. But when you see the talent that was there, it was an honour just to be in the final ".

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> " Mothers of the Disappeared " is a song by rock band U2. It is the eleventh and final track on their 1987 album The Joshua Tree. The song was inspired by lead singer Bono's experiences in Nicaragua and El Salvador in July 1986, following U2's involvement on Amnesty International's A <unk> of Hope tour. He learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a group of women whose children had been " disappeared " by the Argentine and Chilean dictatorships. While in Central America, he met members of COMADRES, a similar organization whose children had been disappeared by the government in El Salvador. Bono <unk> with the Madres and COMADRES and wanted to pay tribute to their cause. 
<|endoftext|> The song was written on a Spanish guitar, and the melody lifted from a piece Bono composed in Ethiopia in 1985 to help teach children basic forms of hygiene. The lyrics contain an implicit criticism of the Reagan Administration, which backed two South American regimes that seized power during coup d <unk> and which provided financial support for the military regime in El Salvador. <unk> it has been interpreted as an examination of failures and contradictions in US foreign policy. 
<|endoftext|> " Mothers of the Disappeared " was favourably received by critics, who variously described it as " powerful ", " a moving tribute ", and containing " stunning beauty and sadness ". The song was played seven times on the 1987 Joshua Tree Tour, and some recordings were considered for the ending sequence of the 1988 film Rattle and Hum. It was revived for four concerts on the 1998 PopMart Tour in South America, and for two of them, the Madres joined the band onstage for the performance, one of which was broadcast on television in Chile. Bono used the opportunity to ask General Pinochet to reveal to the Madres the locations of their children's bodies. The song was played a further three times on the U2 360 ° Tour ; one performance was dedicated to <unk> <unk>, an ethnic <unk> who was forcibly disappeared in Turkey in 1995.

U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A <unk> of Hope tour. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet @-@ led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d 'état. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a group of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres'children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d 'état that brought Jorge Rafael <unk> into power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered. 
<|endoftext|> Inspired by the mural, Bono took an extended break from recording into July, travelling to Nicaragua and El Salvador with his wife, Alison Hewson, to see firsthand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and US military intervention. While there, they worked with the Central American Mission Partners ( <unk> ), a human rights and economic development organization. In El Salvador they met members of the <unk> de Madres Monsignor Romero ( COMADRES : Committee of the Mothers Monsignor Romero ), an organization of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the El <unk> government during the <unk> Civil War because they opposed the military regime that was in power. At one point during the trip, Bono, Alison, and a member of <unk> were shot at by government troops while on their way to deliver aid to a group of farmers. The shots were a warning and, according to author John <unk>, the incident made Bono realize that " they didn 't care for their intrusion and they could kill them if they felt compelled. "

Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to <unk> their attempt, which can be used to strategic advantage ( of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses ). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height ( fewest wins ), and then if still tied, by the total number of misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the <unk>, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one <unk> where they again jump.

In the case of throws, that line is an arc or a circle. Crossing the line while initiating the attempt <unk> the attempt — it becomes a foul. All landings must occur in a sector. For the jumps, that is a sand filled pit, for throws it is a defined sector. A throw landing on the line on the edge of sector is a foul ( the inside edge of the line is the outside edge of the sector ). Assuming a proper attempt, officials measure the distance from the closest landing point back to the line. The measuring tape is carefully <unk> to the shortest distance between the point and the line. To accomplish this, the tape must be perfectly perpendicular to the take off line in jumps, or is pulled through the center point of the arc for throws. The officials at the landing end of the tape have the zero, while the officials at the point of initiation measure and record the length. Whenever a record ( or potential record ) occurs, that measurement is taken ( again ) with a steel tape, and observed by at least three officials ( plus usually the meet referee ). Steel tapes are easily bent and damaged, so are not used to measure everyday competitions. For major competitions, each competitor gets three tries. The top competitors ( usually 8 or 9 depending on that competition's rules or the number of lanes on the track ) gets three more tries. At that level of competition, the order of competitors for those final three attempts are set — so the competitor in first place at the end of the third round is last, while the last competitor to qualify goes first. Some meets <unk> the competition order again for the final round, so the final attempt is taken by the leader at that point.

Producer Ira Steven Behr later recalled that he thought that Deep Space Nine might end up being missed out as he considered it to be the " middle child " of the franchise. However, Rick Berman contacted Behr and asked him if he would be interested in doing something to celebrate the anniversary. Behr agreed to discuss it with the staff writers. Initially, there was concern that if the proposed episode aired during the actual anniversary week ( around September 8 ), that it would have to serve as the season opener, pre @-@ <unk> the already planned opener. 
<|endoftext|> The writers discussed potential ideas. Ronald D.

Some consideration was given by Moore to sending the DS9 crew to the gangster @-@ type planet visited by Kirk in the episode " A Piece of the Action ". It was René Echevarria who suggested a time @-@ travel episode, which was seen as an expensive proposition. Echevarria, however, pressed for the idea. Moore suggested inserting the DS9 crew into " The Trouble with Tribbles ", suggesting it could resolve the question of why a constant stream of tribbles kept hitting Kirk in the head. 
<|endoftext|> When the discussion came to inserting the DS9 crew into the bar @-@ brawl scene, Berman liked the idea but was unsure if it could actually be done. Visual effects supervisor Gary Hutzel created test footage and screened it for Behr and Moore, who thought that it was simply footage from the original episode. Once Hutzel revealed that an additional security officer had been seamlessly added to the sequence, the episode was green @-@ lit. During the <unk> process, " The Trouble with Tribbles " was regularly consulted, so the writers could decide where to insert characters.

Berman asked what the endorsement would cost, to which Gerrold requested public acknowledgement of his work and to be cast as an extra in the episode. Berman agreed. Gerrold compared inserting new footage into an existing episode to Back to the Future Part II ( 1989 ) and later said that he would have gone in a different direction had he written the story.

Visual effects supervisor Dan Curry directed some of the second @-@ unit sequences, and together with West and cinematographer Kris <unk> worked to rectify these issues.

<|endoftext|> Hornung's arguments have greatly influenced other scholars of Egyptian religion, but some still believe that at times the gods were more unified than he allows.

The one god was believed to transcend the world and all the other deities, while at the same time, the multiple gods were aspects of the one. According to Assmann, this one god was especially equated with Amun, the dominant god in the late New Kingdom, whereas for the rest of Egyptian history the universal deity could be identified with many other gods. James P. Allen says that <unk> notions of one god and many gods would fit well with the " multiplicity of approaches " in Egyptian thought, as well as with the <unk> practice of ordinary worshippers. He says that the Egyptians may have recognized the unity of the divine by " identifying their uniform notion of'god'with a particular god, depending on the particular situation. " 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = <unk> and depictions = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Egyptian writings describe the gods'bodies in detail. They are made of precious materials ; their flesh is gold, their bones are silver, and their hair is <unk> <unk>. They give off a scent that the Egyptians likened to the incense used in rituals. Some texts give precise descriptions of particular deities, including their height and eye color. Yet these characteristics are not fixed ; in myths, gods change their appearances to suit their own purposes. Egyptian texts often refer to deities'true, underlying forms as " mysterious ". The Egyptians'visual representations of their gods are therefore not literal. They symbolize specific aspects of each deity's character, functioning much like the <unk> in hieroglyphic writing. For this reason, the funerary god Anubis is commonly shown in Egyptian art as a dog or <unk>, a creature whose <unk> habits threaten the preservation of buried mummies, in an effort to counter this threat and employ it for protection. His black coloring alludes to the color of <unk> flesh and to the fertile black soil that Egyptians saw as a symbol of resurrection. 
<|endoftext|> Most gods were depicted in several ways. Hathor could be a cow, cobra, <unk>, or a woman with <unk> horns or ears. By depicting a given god in different ways, the Egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature. The gods are depicted in a finite number of these symbolic forms, so that deities can often be distinguished from one another by their iconographies. These forms include men and women ( <unk> ), animals ( <unk> ), and, more rarely, <unk> objects. <unk> of forms, such as gods with human bodies and animal heads, are common. New forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history. Some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are labeled in writing, as with Isis and Hathor. Because of the close connection between these goddesses, they could both wear the cow @-@ horn headdress that was originally Hathor's alone. 
<|endoftext|> Certain features of divine images are more useful than others in determining a god's identity. The head of a given divine image is particularly significant. In a hybrid image, the head represents the original form of the being depicted, so that, as the Egyptologist Henry Fischer put it, " a lion @-@ headed goddess is a lion @-@ goddess in human form, while a royal sphinx, <unk>, is a man who has assumed the form of a lion. " Divine <unk>, which range from the same types of crowns used by human kings to large hieroglyphs worn on gods'heads, are another important indicator. In contrast, the objects held in gods'hands tend to be generic. Male deities hold was staffs, goddesses hold stalks of papyrus, and both sexes carry ankh signs, representing the Egyptian word for " life ", to symbolize their life @-@ giving power.

In a birthday <unk> from Rossi's wife in 1817 occurs the earliest use discovered of Meyerbeer's adopted <unk>'Giacomo '. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Recognition = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The name Giacomo Meyerbeer first became known internationally with his opera Il crociato in Egitto — premiered in Venice in 1824 and produced in London and Paris in 1825 ; incidentally, it was the last opera ever written to feature a <unk>, and the last to require keyboard accompaniment for <unk>. This'breakthrough'in Paris was exactly what Meyerbeer had been aiming for over the past ten years ; he had been carefully preparing for it, developing contacts, and fully <unk> his reward. 
<|endoftext|> In 1826, shortly after the death of his father, Meyerbeer married his cousin, <unk> <unk> ( 1804 – 1886 ). The marriage which may have been'dynastic'in its origins proved to be stable and devoted ; the couple were to have five children, of whom the three youngest ( all daughters ) survived to adulthood. In the same year, following the death of Carl Maria von Weber, Weber's widow asked Meyerbeer to complete her husband's unfinished comic opera Die <unk> <unk>. This was to cause him much trouble over future years, as he found the material insufficient to work on. Eventually in 1852 he settled the matter with Weber's heirs by handing them Weber's drafts and a cash compensation. ( The opera was later completed by Gustav Mahler ). 
<|endoftext|> With his next opera Meyerbeer became virtually a superstar. Robert le diable ( with libretto by Eugène Scribe and Germain <unk> ), produced in Paris in 1831, was one of the earliest grand operas. The libretto, originally planned in 1827 as a three @-@ act opéra comique for the Opéra @-@ <unk> theatre, was <unk> after 1829 in a five @-@ act form to meet the requirements of the Paris Opéra. Its revised characterisation as a'grand opera'placed it in succession to Auber's La <unk> de <unk> ( 1828 ) and Rossini's Guillaume Tell ( 1829 ) in this new genre. The composer undertook further work on the opera in early 1831 adding ballet episodes, including the " Ballet of Nuns ", which was to prove one of the opera's great sensations, becoming an early example of the ballet blanc genre. He also rewrote the two major male roles of Bertrand and Robert to suit the talents of Nicolas <unk> and Adolphe Nourrit, respectively. At the invitation of Nourrit, <unk> Falcon made her debut at the age of 18 at the Opéra in the role of Alice on 20 July 1832, and she made a vivid impression on the public, which included on that night Auber, Berlioz, Halévy, Maria <unk>, <unk> <unk>, <unk> <unk>, Alexandre Dumas and Victor Hugo. On hearing her in the role, Meyerbeer himself declared his opera at last'complete '. 
<|endoftext|> The success of the opera led to Meyerbeer himself becoming a celebrity. In January 1832 he was awarded membership of the Légion d 'honneur. This success – coupled with Meyerbeer's known family wealth – inevitably also precipitated envy amongst his peers. Berlioz – who had commented that'Meyerbeer not only had the luck to be talented, he had the talent to be lucky'– wrote'I can 't forget that Meyerbeer was only able to persuade [ the Opéra ] to put on Robert le diable... by paying the administration sixty thousand francs of his own money'; and Chopin lamented'Meyerbeer had to work for three years and pay his own expenses for his stay in Paris before Robert le diable could be staged.... Three years, that's a lot – it's too much.'King Frederick William III of Prussia who attended the second performance of Robert le diable, swiftly invited him to compose a German opera, and Meyerbeer was invited to stage Robert in Berlin. Within a few years the opera had been staged with success all over Europe, and also in the USA.

Discovered in 1845, it was one of the first stegosaurians found. Its only remains, a partial skull and isolated teeth, were found in the Kirkwood Formation. Although Owen initially identified the fragments as those of the pareiasaur Anthodon, after years of storage in the British Museum of Natural History, Broom identified the partial skull as belonging to a different genus, and named the specimen Palaeoscincus africanus. Several years later, Nopcsa, unaware of Broom's new name, similarly concluded that it represented a new taxon, and named the binomial Paranthodon owenii. However, since the Nopcsa's species name was assigned after Broom's, and Broom did not assign a new genus, both names are now synonyms under the current naming, Paranthodon africanus. The genus name was chosen from the Ancient Greek para, " near " and Anthodon, for the originally proposed similarity of the specimens. 
<|endoftext|> In identifying the remains as those of Palaeoscincus, Broom basically classified Paranthodon as an ankylosaurian, a statement backed by the research of Coombs. Nopcsa however, identified the genus as a stegosaurid, which most modern studies agree with. In 1981, the genus was reviewed, and found to be a valid genus of stegosaurid.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The oribi is a small, slender antelope ; it reaches nearly 50 – 67 centimetres ( 20 – 26 in ) at the shoulder and weighs 12 – 22 kilograms ( 26 – 49 lb ). The head @-@ and @-@ body length is typically between 92 and 110 centimetres ( 36 and 43 in ). <unk> dimorphic, males are slightly smaller than females ( except for O. o. ourebi, in which females are smaller ). This antelope features a slightly raised back, and long neck and limbs. The glossy, yellowish to rufous brown coat contrasts with the white chin, throat, underparts and rump. The bushy tail, brown to black on the outside, has white <unk> ( except in O. o. hastata, that has a completely black tail ). The subspecies show some variation in colouration ; O. o. ourebi is a rich rufous, while O. o. hastata is <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Only males possess horns ; the thin, straight horns, 8 – 18 centimetres ( 3 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 1 in ) long, are smooth at the tips and ringed at the base. The maximum horn length, 19 @.@ 1 centimetres ( 7 @.@ 5 in ), was recorded in 1998 from Malawi.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The oribi is diurnal ( active mainly during the day ), though some activity may also be observed at night. The animal rests in cover during rain events. Unlike all other small antelopes, oribi can exhibit three types of mating systems, depending on the habitat – <unk>, polygyny and <unk> ; polygyny tends to prevail as the female @-@ to @-@ male ratio increases. A study suggested that polygyny is preferred in areas of high predator risk, as it leads to formation of groups as an anti @-@ predator measure. Small herds of up to four members are also common. 
<|endoftext|> Males defend their group's territory, 25 – 100 hectares ( 62 – 247 acres ) large ; female members may also show some aggression and drive away intruders. A study showed that the number of females that visit the male's territory depends on the appearance ( particularly the symmetry ) of the male's horns. Males mark vegetation and soil in their territories by <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> ; the intensity of marking increases with the number of male neighbours. <unk> males tend to have greater access to females in and around the territory than other males. An important feature of the social behaviour of oribi is the " dung ceremony ", in which all animals form temporary dung <unk>. Oribi at least three months old have been observed giving out one to three alarm whistles on sensing danger. These whistles are more common in adults than in juveniles, and males appear to whistle more. Common predators include <unk> such as <unk>.

" The name was changed on July 7, 2005, a few months after the game's announcement. 
<|endoftext|> Benoît Hozjan explained Kheops Studio's choice of Jules Verne's work as a basis for Voyage, saying that : " Jules Verne's novels provide the two core elements of adventure games : dreams and challenges. Characters are ordinary men engaged in concrete challenges that are [ a ] great inspiration for puzzles. " He further went on to say that the game is influenced by Verne's From the Earth to the Moon, which documents the lead up to the lunar trip, but draws more heavily from the sequel Around the Moon, which recounts the actual voyage. The main difference, Hozjan said, was that in the novel the protagonists fail to reach the moon, whereas in Voyage the trip is a success. Additionally, Alexis Lang attributed the inspiration for the Selenites to H.G.

On the other hand, GameSpot accused the puzzle aspects of Voyage of " <unk> [ ing ] Jules Verne's tale of a visit to the moon in 1865 to a series of <unk> arranged logic puzzles geared to try the patience of adventure @-@ game veterans. " The puzzles in the game are often extremely difficult, with Just Adventure attributing the unexpected difficulty in the game to the fact that there are often several different ways to achieve the same goals, thanks to the game's " Intelligence Management System ". The game's inventory system received praise from <unk> as being very well done. 
<|endoftext|> In terms of graphics, Voyage was poorly received, with the graphics being described by <unk> as containing some vibrant colors, but lacking the lush, spectacular view that has been seen in countless other adventure games.

Bennett wrote a number of highly acclaimed fantasies between 1917 and 1923 and has been called " the woman who invented dark fantasy ". 
<|endoftext|> Her most famous books include Claimed ( which Augustus T. Swift, in a letter to The Argosy called " One of the <unk> and most compelling science fantasy novels you will ever read " ) and the lost world novel The Citadel of Fear.

She completed school through the eighth grade, then attended night school in hopes of becoming an illustrator ( a goal she never achieved ). Instead, she began working as a stenographer, a job she held on and off for the rest of her life. 
<|endoftext|> In 1909 Barrows married Stewart Bennett, a British journalist and explorer, and moved to Philadelphia. A year later her husband died while on an expedition. With a new @-@ born daughter to raise, Bennett continued working as a stenographer. When her father died toward the end of World War I, Bennett assumed care for her invalid mother. 
<|endoftext|> During this time period Bennett began to write a number of short stories and novels, only stopping when her mother died in 1920. In the mid @-@ 1920s, she moved to California. Because Bennett was estranged from her daughter, for a number of years researchers believed Bennett died in 1939 ( the date of her final letter to her daughter ). However, new research, including her death certificate, shows that she died in 1948. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Writing career = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Bennett wrote her first short story at age 17, a science fiction story titled " The Curious Experience of Thomas Dunbar ". She <unk> the story to Argosy, then one of the top pulp magazines. The story was accepted and published in the March 1904 issue. 
<|endoftext|> Once Bennett began to take care of her mother, she decided to return to fiction writing as a means of supporting her family. The first story she completed after her return to writing was the novella " The Nightmare, " which appeared in All @-@ Story Weekly in 1917. The story is set on an island separated from the rest of the world, on which evolution has taken a different course. " The Nightmare " resembles Edgar Rice <unk>'The Land That Time <unk>, itself published a year later. While Bennett had submitted " The Nightmare " under her own name, she had asked to use a pseudonym if it was published. The magazine's editor chose not to use the pseudonym Bennett suggested ( Jean <unk> ) and instead credited the story to Francis Stevens. When readers responded positively to the story, Bennett chose to continue writing under the name. 
<|endoftext|> Over the next few years, Bennett wrote a number of short stories and <unk>. Her short story " Friend Island " ( All @-@ Story Weekly, 1918 ), for example, is set in a 22nd @-@ century ruled by women. Another story is the novella " Serapion " ( Argosy, 1920 ), about a man possessed by a supernatural creature. This story has been released in an electronic book entitled Possessed : A Tale of the Demon Serapion, with three other stories by her. Many of her short stories have been collected in The Nightmare and Other Tales of Dark Fantasy ( University of Nebraska Press, 2004 ). 
<|endoftext|> In 1918 she published her first, and perhaps best, novel The Citadel of Fear ( Argosy, 1918 ). This lost world story focuses on a forgotten Aztec city, which is " rediscovered " during World War I. It was in the introduction to a 1952 reprint edition of the novel which revealed for the first time that " Francis Stevens " was Bennett's pen @-@ name. 
<|endoftext|> A year later she published her only science fiction novel, The Heads of Cerberus ( The Thrill Book, 1919 ).
<|endoftext|> different DAGs may give rise to the same reachability relation and the same partial order. For example, the DAG with two edges a → b and b → c has the same reachability relation as the graph with three edges a → b, b → c, and a → c. Both of these <unk> produce the same partial order, in which the vertices are ordered as a ≤ b ≤ c. 
<|endoftext|> If G is a DAG, its transitive closure is the graph with the most edges that represents the same reachability relation. It has an edge u → v whenever u can reach v. That is, it has an edge for every related pair u ≤ v of distinct elements in the reachability relation of G, and may therefore be thought of as a direct translation of the reachability relation ≤ into graph @-@ <unk> terms. The same method of translating partial orders into DAGs works more generally : for every finite partially ordered set ( S, ≤ ), the graph that has a vertex for each member of S and an edge for each pair of elements related by u ≤ v is automatically a <unk> closed DAG, and has ( S, ≤ ) as its reachability relation. In this way, every finite partially ordered set can be represented as the reachability relation of a DAG. 
<|endoftext|> The transitive reduction of a DAG G is the graph with the fewest edges that represents the same reachability relation as G. It is a subgraph of G, formed by discarding the edges u → v for which G also contains a longer path connecting the same two vertices. Like the transitive closure, the transitive reduction is uniquely defined for DAGs. In contrast, for a directed graph that is not acyclic, there can be more than one minimal subgraph with the same reachability relation. 
<|endoftext|> If a DAG G has a reachability relation described by the partial order ≤, then the transitive reduction of G is a subgraph of G that has an edge u → v for every pair in the covering relation of ≤. <unk> reductions are useful in <unk> the partial orders they represent, because they have fewer edges than other graphs representing the same orders and therefore lead to simpler graph drawings. A <unk> diagram of a partial order is a drawing of the transitive reduction in which the orientation of each edge is shown by placing the starting vertex of the edge in a lower position than its ending vertex. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = = Topological ordering = = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Every directed acyclic graph has a topological ordering, an ordering of the vertices such that the starting endpoint of every edge occurs earlier in the ordering than the ending endpoint of the edge. The existence of such an ordering can be used to characterize DAGs : a directed graph is a DAG if and only if it has a topological ordering. In general, this ordering is not unique ; a DAG has a unique topological ordering if and only if it has a directed path containing all the vertices, in which case the ordering is the same as the order in which the vertices appear in the path. 
<|endoftext|> The family of topological orderings of a DAG is the same as the family of linear extensions of the reachability relation for the DAG, so any two graphs representing the same partial order have the same set of topological orders.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The graph <unk> problem of counting directed acyclic graphs was studied by Robinson ( 1973 ). The number of DAGs on n labeled vertices, for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, … ( without restrictions on the order in which these numbers appear in a topological ordering of the DAG ) is

He proposed it to Major @-@ General Sandy MacLean, then the Rhodesian Army's second @-@ in @-@ command, while they were visiting France together. MacLean relayed the idea to the General Staff in Salisbury, which decided in late 1977 to form a " French battalion " to alleviate the strain on its regular units. A Rhodesian officer of French extraction, Cyril Bernard, warned his superiors strongly against the scheme, but was ultimately himself sent to France to start the project. On the way he stopped in Zurich, Switzerland, where MacLean gave him final approval for the operation and a budget of US $ 30 @,@ 000. They resolved to recruit mainly in Paris and Lyon. Bernard then entered France and renewed old connections from the French military academy at Saint @-@ <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> <unk> was carried out by a former French paratrooper, Roger <unk>, operating from an apartment on Rue <unk> in central Paris. Advertisements, placed in newspapers such as France Soir, offered " a job with a future abroad... minimum age 22, former non @-@ commissioned officers preferred ". The body of men eventually assembled varied widely in terms of age, background and experience, but was based largely around ex @-@ paratroopers and former Foreign Legionnaires. The average age was about 25. French @-@ speaking veterans of an assortment of African and Middle Eastern conflicts spanning the previous two decades successfully applied, but past service did not prove a necessity ; some of the men accepted had no military experience. Most of them spoke English only at a basic level if at all. 
<|endoftext|> Once signed up, each man was instructed to travel to Switzerland, where appropriate <unk> were swiftly procured from the South African Embassy. In early November 1977, the French recruits flew from Zurich to Johannesburg on a South African Airways liner, then to Salisbury by Air Rhodesia.

<|endoftext|> The monument originally consisted of a sarsen stone chamber, covered by a low earthen mound, which was bounded by prostrate slabs. As such, the archaeologist Paul Ashbee asserted that the monument could be divided into three particular features : the chamber, the barrow, and the sarsen stone surround. It is located on the edge of a large <unk> <unk>, although it is difficult to <unk> what views would have been possible from the monument at the time of construction, due to a lack of information on how densely forested the vicinity was. However, if the area was not highly wooded, then 360 ° views of the surrounding landscape would have been possible. The monument's axis points toward both the North Downs and the Medway Valley, which is similar to the other Medway Megaliths. Archaeologist <unk> <unk> suggested that the Coldrum Long Barrow might have been built within view of a nearby settlement, and that this " may have been a key factor in the experience of ceremonies and rituals taking place at the tombs and may also have defined a link between the tomb builders and the landscape. " 
<|endoftext|> It had been built using about 50 stones. The barrow is sub @-@ rectangular in plan, and about 20 meters ( 64 feet ) in length. At its broader, eastern end, where the chamber is located, the monument measures 15 metres ( 50 feet ), while at the narrower, western end, it is 12 metres ( 40 feet ) in breadth. As such, the barrow is a " truncated wedge @-@ shape ". The megalithic builders responsible for the Coldrum Stones positioned it on the top of a small ridge adjacent to the North Downs, and constructed it facing eastward, towards the River Medway. 
<|endoftext|> The chamber of the monument measures 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 13 feet ) in length, and 1 @.@ 7 metres ( 5 feet 6 inches ) in width, although it was potentially much larger when originally constructed. The chamber's internal height would have been at least 2 metres ( 6 feet 6 inches ). In its current state, the northern side of the chamber is made up of two slabs, one being 8 feet long, 7 feet, 6 inches deep, and 1 foot, 9 inches thick, and the other 5 feet long, 6 feet deep, and 2 feet thick. Conversely, the chamber's southern side consists of a single slab, measuring 11 feet, 4 inches in length, 7 feet, 3 inches in depth, and 1 foot, 9 inches in depth at its thicker, eastern end. The western end of the chamber is closed off with a slab measuring about 14 feet, 6 inches wide, with a thickness of 1 foot and a depth of around 8 feet. A collapsed, broken slab lies at the opening eastern end of the chamber. It is also possible that a largely rectangular slab at the bottom of the slope had once been part of the eastern end of the chamber. Excavation has revealed that flint masonry was used to pack around the chamber and support its sarsens ; twentieth @-@ century renovation has seen this largely replaced with cement, allowing the stones to continue standing upright. 
<|endoftext|> It is possible that there was a facade in front of the chamber, as is evident at other chambered tombs in Britain, such as West Kennet Long Barrow and <unk>'s Smithy. It is also possible that there was a portal stone atop the chamber, as was apparent at Kit's Coty House and Lower Kit's Coty House. Many of the larger slabs of stone that have fallen down the slope on the eastern end of the monument may have been parts of this facade or portal. 
<|endoftext|> The earthen mound that once covered the tomb is now visible only as an <unk> approximately 1 foot, 6 inches in height. In the nineteenth @-@ century, the mound was higher on the western end of the tomb, although this was removed by excavation to reveal the sarsens beneath during the 1920s. It is likely that in the Early Neolithic, the mound had a quarry ditch surrounding it, and it is inside this ditch that the kerb @-@ stones now sit. 
<|endoftext|> The kerb @-@ stones around the tomb display some <unk> ; those on the northern side are mostly rectilinear, while those on the southern side are smaller and largely irregular in shape. It is probable that there was an ancillary dry @-@ stone wall constructed using blocks of <unk> from the geological <unk> beds, as is evident at Chestnuts Long Barrow. Given that such blocks of stone rarely occur naturally, it may have been <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> A <unk> line of <unk> and <unk> can be found on both one of the central kerb @-@ stones on the western end of

<|endoftext|> However, during the unveiling of the monster, Burns is blinded by camera flashes. He runs into a camera, which crashes and starts a fire : the crowd panic and flee. Following this disaster, Homer then cheers up Burns by pointing out that being loved means you have to be nice to people everyday but being hated means you do not have to do anything. Burns agrees with that logic, saying " I'm a selfish old <unk> that fits me like a <unk>! " In the aftermath of the incident, Homer and Burns give <unk> a job at the " Vegas Town Casino ".

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> " Monty Can 't Buy Me Love " was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by Mark <unk>. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 2, 1999. The inspiration for the episode came from the concept of " <unk> ", a term the Simpsons writers found in an issue of The Economist to describe <unk> who " do really incredible stunts " and " go on amazing adventures ". The episode's third act went through several <unk>, and the writers had a lot of ideas about what Burns should do once he has captured the Loch Ness monster. Eventually, the staff settled on the act's current iteration, which was conceived by Simpsons writer George Meyer. According to current showrunner Al Jean, the color of the Loch Ness monster would originally be green, but when the overseas animation was completed, the Loch Ness monster had a " kind of pinkish " color. Because it would be too expensive to re @-@ color all the <unk> in which the monster appears, the staff decided to air the episode as it was, even though the monster was in the wrong color. Inside the Fortune Megastore, Simpsons staff writer Ian <unk> @-@ Graham can be seen. 
<|endoftext|> The episode features American comedian and composer Michael McKean as Jerry Rude, a parody on the radio personality Howard Stern. Scully stated that McKean was " very funny " and that his Stern impression was " dead on the money ". The Simpsons staff originally asked Stern if he wanted to guest @-@ star in the episode, but he declined. Actor and producer Kevin <unk> was portrayed by series regular cast member Hank Azaria, who voices Moe <unk> among other characters in the series. Azaria also played Arthur Fortune, a character based on British business magnate Richard Branson. In the DVD commentary for the episode, Scully stated that Branson would have been a " great guest [ <unk> ] " in the episode.

<|endoftext|> When the castle was remodelled in the early 13th century, the entrance was moved to the south wall. The chapel was lit by windows above the <unk>, one at the west end, one on either side of the east bay, and one on the south side of the central bay, and the apse at the east end had a large window. In 1935 a second chapel was discovered outside the castle's main entrance, however it no longer survives.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The second phase of building work undertaken by the Hospitallers began in the early 13th century and lasted decades. The outer walls were built in the last major construction on the site, lending the Krak des Chevaliers its current appearance. Standing 9 metres ( 30 ft ) high, the outer circuit had towers that projected strongly from the wall. While the towers of the inner court had a square plan and did not project far beyond the wall, the towers of the 13th @-@ century outer walls were rounded. This design was new and even contemporary Templar castles did not have rounded towers. The technique was developed at <unk> Gaillard in France by Richard the <unk> between <unk> and <unk>. The extension to the southeast is of lesser quality than the rest of the circuit and was built at an unknown date. Probably around the 1250s a <unk> was added to the north wall. 
<|endoftext|> Arrow slits in the walls and towers were distributed to minimize the amount of dead ground around the castle. <unk> crowned the walls, offering defenders a way to <unk> projectiles towards enemies at the foot of the wall. They were so cramped <unk> would have had to crouch inside them. The box <unk> were unusual : those at Krak des Chevaliers were more complex that those at <unk> or Margat and there were no comparable features amongst Crusader castles. However, they bore similarities to Muslim work, such as the contemporary defences at the Citadel of Aleppo. It is unclear which side imitated the other, as the date they were added to Krak des Chevaliers is unknown, but it does provide evidence for the <unk> of military ideas between the Muslim and Christian armies. These defences were accessed by a wall @-@ walk known as a chemin de <unk>. In the opinion of historian Hugh Kennedy the defences of the outer wall were " the most elaborate and developed anywhere in the Latin east... the whole structure is a brilliantly designed and superbly built fighting machine ". 
<|endoftext|> When the outer walls were built in the 13th century the main entrance was enhanced. A vaulted corridor led uphill from the outer gate in the northeast. The corridor made a hairpin turn halfway along its length, making it an example of a bent entrance. Bent entrances were a Byzantine innovation, but that at Krak des Chevaliers was a particularly complex example. It extended for 137 metres ( 450 ft ), and along its length were murder @-@ holes which allowed defenders to shower attackers with missiles. Anyone going straight ahead rather than following the hairpin turn would emerge in the area between the castle's two circuits of walls. To access the inner ward, the passage had to be followed round.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Despite its predominantly military character, the castle is one of the few sites where Crusader art ( in the form of frescoes ) has been preserved. In 1935, 1955, and 1978 medieval frescoes were discovered within Krak des Chevaliers after later plaster and white @-@ wash had decayed. The <unk> were painted on the interior and exterior of the main chapel and the chapel outside the main entrance, which no longer survives. Writing in 1982, historian <unk> <unk> noted that at the time there had been little investigation of Crusader frescoes that would provide a comparison for the fragmentary remains found at Krak des Chevaliers. Those in the chapel were painted on the masonry from the 1170 – <unk> rebuild. <unk>, smoke, and moisture have made it difficult to preserve the frescoes. The fragmentary nature of the red and blue frescoes inside the chapel means they are difficult to assess. The one on the exterior of the chapel depicted the Presentation of Jesus at the Temple.

Johnston's voice then changed from a tenor to a baritone. After remaining out of the spotlight for two years, he joined the National Youth Choir, saying " I'm just another lad in there – no one focuses on Britain's Got Talent and I'm happy about that ".

Swedish holdings at that time included territory in Northern Germany, all of modern Finland and most of the Baltic states, a dominion depending on, and connected by, the Baltic Sea trade routes. During the Great Northern War ( 1700 – 1721 ), Sweden lost all its territories in the Baltic states and suffered Russian raids in Finland and along the chain of islands and <unk> stretching from the Gulf of Finland to Stockholm. The Swedes began to deploy inshore flotillas of shallow @-@ draft vessels, beginning with smaller versions of the traditional Mediterranean galleys. Most of these new vessels were more akin to <unk> and were complemented with gun prams. The disastrous war with Russia ( 1741 – 43 ) and the minor involvement against Prussia in the Seven Years'War ( 1757 – 62 ) showed the need for further expansion and development of the inshore flotillas with more specialized vessels.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> After the Russian victory against Sweden in 1743, the Swedes established a commission to identify weaknesses in the eastern defenses. In 1747, the commission concluded that the fortifications in southeastern Finland needed to be improved and expanded, and that Sweden needed to build a strong coastal navy. Augustin Ehrensvärd ( 1710 – 72 ), an artillery officer, was the driving force behind these changes. The committee based many of its conclusions and decisions on his ideas. In 1756, Sweden established the archipelago fleet with the official name <unk> <unk> ( " fleet of the army " ) under the command of the army department, <unk>, with Ehrensvärd as supreme commander. For two decades, the struggle for power between the Hats and the <unk>, the dominant political factions at the time, and rivalries between army and navy brought about changes to the archipelago fleet. The parliamentary victory of the Hats in the <unk> in 1769 – 70 and the coup d <unk> by King Gustav III in 1772 secured the archipelago fleet's status as an independent branch of the army. Starting in 1770, the archipelago fleet merged with the Finnish Squadron ( <unk> <unk> ) based at Sveaborg. In 1777, it incorporated the Swedish Squadron ( <unk> <unk> ), the galley fleet based at Stockholm. The Swedish armed forces invested considerable resources in the new army branch and made it a professional, independent organization. The archipelago fleet attracted members of the social and cultural elite who enjoyed the protection and patronage of King Gustav III, who had established himself as an absolute monarch in the 1772 coup.

Augustin Ehrensvärd argued for new archipelago vessels that combined firepower, maneuverability, <unk>, and decent crew accommodations. He began a successful collaboration with <unk> Fredrik Henrik Chapman ( <unk> " <unk> Chapman " in 1772 ), and together they developed five new vessels : a gunboat with a 12 @-@ pounder gun and a schooner rigging, as well as four types of " archipelago frigates " ( <unk> ) : the smaller <unk> and <unk>, and the larger turuma and hemmema.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Hoysala literature is the large body of literature in the Kannada and Sanskrit languages produced by the Hoysala Empire ( <unk> – <unk> ) in what is now southern India. The empire was established by <unk> Kama II, came into political prominence during the rule of King Vishnuvardhana ( 1108 – <unk> ), and declined gradually after its defeat by the <unk> dynasty invaders in <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Kannada literature during this period consisted of writings relating to the socio @-@ religious developments of the Jain and Veerashaiva faiths, and to a lesser extent that of the Vaishnava faith. The earliest well @-@ known brahmin writers in Kannada were from the Hoysala court. While most of the courtly textual production was in Kannada, an important corpus of monastic Vaishnava literature relating to Dvaita ( <unk> ) philosophy was written by the renowned philosopher Madhvacharya in Sanskrit.

<|endoftext|> Up to the point the episode " August " aired, only one character that was part of a group known as " Observers " had been introduced. In this episode, two more such individuals were revealed : August ( played by Peter Woodward ) and December ( played by Eugene <unk> ). The creation of Observers was one of the first ideas the writers of Fringe thought of when developing the show in its early stages, when they asked each other, " What if there were these characters where all they did was watch? ". Pinkner and Wyman thought of creating Observers by " looking for something... iconic " that had the " quality of being invisible ". Though the Observer called September has appeared in every single Fringe episode in a brief cameo, he was first featured prominently in the fourth episode of the first season. The producers thought of unique characteristics for " somebody who wasn 't of our world, " evolving to the Observers having bald heads, no eyebrows, and " largely <unk> " senses, which led to a love for extremely hot <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> Before the second season premiere aired in September 2009, co @-@ creator <unk> Orci hinted that the audience was going to meet " many Observers ", and that in the season's eighth episode, " You're going to find out their role in the world, what they're named after, and their connection to some of these characters. " Later on, when still leading up to the airing of " August " in another interview, Roberto Orci elaborated that " <unk> will be one of the things that they will be <unk> struggling with, actually. That was a fun one, because that one was one where you're finally getting to pay off things you've been setting up for a year. You finally get to open the toy box and really play with those toys ". Actor Michael <unk>, who plays September, commented in an interview that as a result of the episode, viewers would learn that the Observers " are not completely devoid of feelings, and are not incapable of being attached to people they're observing ". He also expressed relief that his character was no longer the sole Observer on the show, joking that " it was nice to feel like I'm not the only freak in town for once ". 
<|endoftext|> Actress Anna Torv stated in an interview with MTV News that " August " was one of her favorite episodes because " We sort of get to meet the Observers. At the moment what we know about them, they... seemingly just observe. That's kind of it, but [ in ] the episode that we have coming up, we're not sure if all they do is just observe ".

In 1124, Song officials further angered the Jin by asking for the <unk> of nine more border prefectures. The new Jin emperor Taizong ( r. 1123 – 1135 ), Aguda's brother and successor, hesitated, but warrior princes Wanyan Zonghan and Wanyan Zongwang ( <unk> ) vehemently refused to give them any more territory.

The returning envoy reported that the Jurchens were willing to <unk> an invasion if the Song ceded control of Hebei and Shanxi to the Jin. Tong Guan retreated from Taiyuan and left command of his troops to Wang Bing. Jin armies besieged the city in mid January 1126.

When the Song had tried to reclaim the Sixteen Prefectures, they had faced fierce resistance from the Han Chinese population, yet when the Jurchens invaded that area, the Han Chinese did not oppose them at all.

<|endoftext|> example is the coarse <unk> fringe of broad triangular <unk> on the frill of Triceratops. When regarding the ossification's <unk> traits, it can be described as dermal. The term <unk> was coined by famous paleontologist Othniel Charles Marsh in 1889. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = History of study = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> The first ceratopsian remains known to science were discovered during the U.S. Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories led by the American geologist <unk> <unk>. <unk> discovered during an 1855 expedition to Montana were first assigned to hadrosaurids and included within the genus Trachodon. It was not until the early 20th century that some of these were recognized as ceratopsian teeth. During another of <unk>'s expeditions in 1872, Fielding Bradford <unk> found several giant bones protruding from a hillside in southwestern Wyoming. He alerted paleontologist Edward <unk> Cope, who led a dig to recover the partial skeleton. Cope recognized the remains as a dinosaur, but noted that even though the fossil lacked a skull, it was different from any type of dinosaur then known. He named the new species Agathaumas <unk>, meaning " marvellous forest @-@ dweller ". Soon after, Cope named two more dinosaurs that would eventually come to be recognized as ceratopsids : <unk> and Monoclonius. Monoclonius was notable for the number of <unk> remains found, including the first evidence of ceratopsid horns and frills. Several Monoclonius fossils were found by Cope, assisted by Charles <unk> Sternberg, in the summer of 1876 near the Judith River in <unk> County, Montana. Since the ceratopsians had not been recognised yet as a distinctive group, Cope was uncertain about much of the fossil material, not recognizing the nasal horn core, nor the brow horns, as part of a fossil horn. The frill bone was interpreted as a part of the <unk>. 
<|endoftext|> In 1888 and 1889, Othniel Charles Marsh described the first well preserved horned dinosaurs, Ceratops and Triceratops. In 1890 Marsh classified them together in the family Ceratopsidae and the order Ceratopsia. This prompted Cope to <unk> his own specimens and to realized that Triceratops, Monoclonius, and Agathaumas all represented a single group of similar dinosaurs, which he named <unk> in 1891. Cope <unk> Monoclonius as a horned dinosaur, with a large nasal horn and two smaller horns over the eyes, and a large frill. 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> = = Classification = = 
<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Ceratopsia was coined by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1890 to include dinosaurs possessing certain characteristic features, including horns, a rostral bone, teeth with two roots, fused neck vertebrae, and a forward @-@ oriented <unk>. Marsh considered the group distinct enough to warrant its own suborder within <unk>. The name is derived from the Greek <unk> / <unk> meaning'horn'and <unk> / <unk> meaning'face '. As early as the 1960s, it was noted that the name Ceratopsia is actually incorrect linguistically and that it should be <unk>. However, this spelling, while technically correct, has been used only rarely in the scientific literature, and the vast majority of paleontologists continue to use Ceratopsia. As the <unk> does not govern taxa above the level of superfamily, this is unlikely to change.

<|endoftext|><|endoftext|> Following Marsh, Ceratopsia has usually been classified as a suborder within the order <unk>. While ranked taxonomy has largely fallen out of favor among dinosaur paleontologists, some researchers have continued to employ such a classification, though sources have differed on what its rank should be. Most who still employ the use of ranks have retained its traditional ranking of suborder, though some have reduced to the level of <unk>.
