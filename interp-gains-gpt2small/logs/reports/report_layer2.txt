Here’s a detailed and specific breakdown of the differences among the four files, which can be used to cluster them into four categories:

	•	Primarily discusses biographies, historical events, and labor activism.
	•	Includes detailed references to political movements like the Independent Labour Party (ILP) and individuals involved in suffragette movements.
	•	Focuses on notable figures in labor and women’s rights, discussing their contributions and struggles.
	•	Structure:
	•	Organized into biographical sections with headings like = = Biography = =, = = = Childhood and family = = =, and = = = Early career = = =.

Clustering

Based on the differences, the files can be categorized into four clusters:
	1.	Cluster 1: Historical and Biographical Narratives
	•	Includes File 1 and partially File 2.
	•	Focuses on labor activism, biographies, and historical movements.
	2.	Cluster 2: Cultural and Artifacts-Oriented Content
	•	Includes File 2.
	•	Emphasizes historical artifacts, public exhibitions, and their cultural significance.
	3.	Cluster 3: Fictional and Game Lore
	•	Includes File 3.
	•	Dedicated to video game characters, storylines, and mechanics.
	4.	Cluster 4: Mixed Media (Wrestling and Opera)
	•	Includes File 4.
	•	Combines professional wrestling narratives with opera company histories.

This detailed mapping highlights the unique features and focus areas of each file, justifying their categorization. Let me know if further analysis is needed!
